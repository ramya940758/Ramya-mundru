"Terrifier 2 ups the Ante big time in terms of gore, scares and most importantly, storyline! While the first film was simply a really gory slasher, part 2 takes a deep dive into the story of Art and the 2 main characters Sienna and Jonathan.Over the top doesn't even begin to describe the kills in this movie. Art takes people out in the most gruesome ways possible including bashing a dude's skull open to eat his brain, splitting a girl's chest open to eat her heart, Tommy gunning several people in one room and slicing a woman apart then pouring salt and bleach in her wounds. There's even a classic Savini style shotgun to the head scene. The gore scenes are absolutely top notch 80s style practical FX.While Art remains creepy, his sidekick Pale Girl is what nightmares are made of. She is so scary in every scene she's in.The story follows Sienna and Jonathan as they randomly encounter Art and Pale Girl all the way up to an all out battle with the killer clown. They're also still reeling from the loss of their father who may or may not actually be Art. There is a lot of potential story explored but not answered including Pale Girl's origin and many supernatural elements that hint toward being revealed in Part 3.Any Slasher fan or Gore Hound simply MUST see Terrifier 2. It's the goriest slasher in years! Simply a balls out, pull no punches, Grindhouse style flick that is sorely lacking these days.I give Terrifier 2 a 93%",neutral
"A mumbo jumbo impressive, f**up sequel with the ever star Art the Clown, where no professional clown could have done a better job. It has at least 25 minutes over-runtime, the folks in the editing room where probably asleep all the way. It features an impressive Lauren LaVera who looks 6 years less and does a more than decent job acting-wise.The gore and super visual effects, besides the blood color, are plenty, but as they are scattered randomly and sort of unimpressively throughout, they fail to ignite the desired effects.If they do a better job with the film logic, the 'Terrifier' productions could be memorable and ill-enthralling.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 5Development: 7.5Realism: 7Entertainment: 7.5Acting: 8Filming/photography/cinematography: 7VFX: 8Music/score/sound: 6.5Depth: 2.5Logic: 1Flow: 7.5Horror/thriller: 7.5Ending: 4.5.",negative
"The evil clown antagonist first appeared in the two short films, then in an anthology movie, before getting his own spin-off solo movie, it became a cult hit, so it's natural it spawned a sequel, but with a bigger budget, with special effects, sound design, edited, written, produced and directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve). Basically, following the Miles County Massacre, Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) has been resurrected by an unknown entity. The medical examiner (Cory DuVal) investigating his body has been attacked and tries calling the police, but his neck has been slashed and he is unable to speak. The coroner is bludgeoned to death with a hammer, and Art removes his eyeball to replace his own damaged eye. Art grabs his bag of tools and knives, evading the police driving past, and goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments. There, he encounters The Little Pale Girl (Amelie McLain), a mysterious sinister entity in similar clown attire. A lone patron (Thomas Smith) sees Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him. Art changes into his clean costume and cleans up the blood, walking out with his bag and passing the dead man, stabbed in the head with a broken broom handle. A year later, during Halloween, teenager Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is putting the finishing touches on her costume: an angel-warrior outfit based on a creation by her father, who recently died of a brain tumour. Sienna's younger brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) wants to dress as Art the Clown but their mother Barbara (Sarah Voigt) objects to this. Sienna worries about what Jonathan has been looking at online, as he has become fixated with the clown, looking at police sketches of him online and reading about his victims. That night, Sienna has a nightmare where she encounters Art. In the dream, Sienna is a member of the Clown Café, a TV show themed around Art, and he slaughters everybody on the TV set with a machine gun and a flamethrower. When he wakes up, Sienna's angel wings and her dresser have caught fire until Barbara puts it out. Barbara assumes the fire was caused by candles left burning but Sienna insists they were not lit. Sienna returns to her room and finds her a sword, a gift to her from her father, unscathed after the fire. In his lair, Art is watching television with the Little Pale Girl, and the interview between Monica Brown (Katie Maguire) and Victoria (Samantha Scaffidi) is broadcast before he smashes the TV. At school, Jonathan sees Art and the Little Pale Girl in the corridor playing with a dead opossum. Sienna's friends Brooke (Kailey Hyman) and Allie (Casey Hartnett) talk about Victoria's meltdown and attacking Monica Brown, and they mention a clown that she recognises as Art in her nightmare. Jonathan has been sent home after it was assumed he brought in the dead opossum, but Barbara will not listen to him. Sienna and Allie visit a costume shop to buy some replacement angel wings where Sienna is unnerved by Art who stares at her while playing with the toys of the store. After she leaves, Art irritates shop clerk Ricky (Johnath Davis) before smashing his head with a bottle, stabbing him in the face, and decapitating him with a cleaver. Back home, Jonathan tells Sienna he saw the Miles County killer and shows her their father's sketchbook. It contains various drawings their father drew (perhaps unconsciously) of Art and his victims. Later, Art visits Allie at her home and appears to be trick-or-treating, she eventually gives him candy to go away and is disturbed to see his bag filled with bloodied tools before he leaves. While Sienna is at home getting dressed up in her completed angel-warrior costume, Art has returned to Allie's house and broken in. She catches him in the kitchen, he chases her into the bedroom and mutilates her face, cuts off her scalp and her arm, and slashes her several times, before returning with salt to pour all over her and ripping her face off. Barbara remarks to Sienna that her outfit is revealing but allows her to go to her party. Allie's mother (Amy Russ) returns home and discovers the break-in and screams in terror finding Art and her daughter's still-breathing body maimed. At the party, Sienna is concerned that Allie hasn't shown up, but Brooke persuades her to have a few drinks and introduces her boyfriend Jeff (Charlie McElveen). Back at Allie's house, a group of trick-or-treaters knocks at the door, and Art hands them out candy from inside Allie's mother's severed head, the children unaware that it is real. Barbara comes to Jonathan's room and confronts him about the school incident, but he insists he is innocent. He shows her their father's drawings, but she insists that he was sick and didn't know what he was doing. She rips up the sketchbook and Jonathan name-calls her, and he runs away after she slaps him. Later, Barbara goes to the garage and finds the car covered with shaving cream, toilet paper, eggs, pumpkin and a swear word. Back at the party, Sienna talks about how great she is feeling, and Brooke reveals that she put ecstasy pills in their drinks. Barbara calls Sienna to tell her what she believes Jonathan has done to the car, and they have a small heart-to-heart. While cleaning the car, Barbara is attacked by Art who is inside. While dancing and on a high, Sienna sees the Little Pale Girl and screams in terror before Brooke calms her down. Meanwhile, after seeing the Little Pale Girl himself, Jonathan has run back home. There, he finds Barbara dead in the dining room, with her head mangled, and Art walks in wearing an apron, serving mashed potato, and shoving it into the mother's smashed face. Art chases Jonathan into his bedroom and sedates him. While Jeff is driving Sienna and Brooke, Sienna receives a call from Jonathan that he needs help, but it is the Little Pale Girl imitating his voice to lure her to the abandoned carnival site. At the run-down site, Sienna gets out of the car to search for her brother while Brooke and Jeff stay behind, eventually making out and doing cocaine. Jonathan wakes up in the Terrifier circus-themed haunted attraction where the Little Pale Girl scares him, and Sienna enters it. Jeff gets out of the car to urinate; he is stabbed to death by Art and his penis is removed. Brooke escapes and is chased into the Terrifier attraction. Cornered in a derelict and blood-covered bathroom, Brooke has fluoroantimonic acid thrown in her face; she is killed by Art when he pulverises her with a mallet covered in spikes. Jonathan walks in moments after Sienna has discovered Brooke's body, she hits Art, but he knocks her unconscious before chasing after the boy. Art corners Jonathan, choking him and cutting his face, before Sienna smacks him with the mallet. Finding a place to rest, Jonathan believes that they have been brought to this place for a reason. Art catches up to the siblings and whips them continuously with a makeshift cat o' nine tails until Sienna manages to fight back and seemingly kills him with a steel rod. Art resurrects again and pins Sienna to the ground before Jonathan grabs his gun and shoots him dead. Sienna is unconscious and has a vision of her mother comforting her before waking. She finds Jonathan has been taken and finds Art outside standing over her unconscious brother; she stabs him several times with a knife to no effect. Art kills Sienna with her father's sword and throws her into a water torture cell. Sienna mysteriously wakes in the water and has visions of her nightmare before drowning. While Art approaches Jonathan and starts trying to eat him, the sword glows and resurrects Sienna. She stabs Art in the back of the head with the sword, hacking part of him, before he pauses to smile before she decapitates him. As Sienna comforts her brother, the Little Pale Girl appears and stares at them; she takes Art's head and leaves without attacking the siblings. In a mid-credits scene, at Miles County Psychiatric Hospital, an institutionalised Victoria is bleeding from her vagina, and uses the blood to write obscenities and the names ""Vicky + Art"". She gives birth to Art's living head, leaving a horrified nurse (Leah Voysey) screaming. Also starring Chris Jericho as Burke, Felissa Rose as Ms. Principe, Owen Myre as Sean, Griffin Santopietro as Eric, Devon L. Roth as Stephanie, Staci Dickerson as The Principal, and Marisa Bertani as News Anchor. Thornton is remains sinister as the insane black-and-white circus performer who is silent and often smiley throughout his various murders, and LaVera is well cast as the cosplayer heroine. It is fair to say that this film does overdo its slightly, two hours feels a little long and excessive, I can point out many moments that could have been shortened or cut. However, there are a few more touches of humour in amongst the barrage of violence, it is certainly gorier with extreme stomach-churning blood spill and more body parts taken apart and sliced up, and the atmosphere and tension are still spot on, I cannot wait for the third entry, a most watchable slasher horror. Good!",positive
"Damien Leone is a wizard of gore. Art the Clown is so much fun. I had to get both of these on dvd. Been working on my collection and these films were needed. This world needs films like this. Absolutely unhinged and ultraviolent but with an undercurrent of gleeful dark humor. Takes everything that made the first film great and cranks it up beyond all limits. The film is full of huge surprises and unforgettable characters, my personal favourite being the little girl clown who is jaw-dropping. Her performance is extremely impressive and David Howard Thornton owns the screen again. He's effortlessly... terrifying... and absolutely hysterical. Leone's direction and story are ambitious and the film manages to succeed in every crazy thing it does. The Clown Cafe sequences in particular are a stroke of genius. The weird fantasy twists near the end? Sure why not! People somehow surviving impossible amounts of pain and mutilation only to get literal salt dumped on them. Maybe it's my sense of humor but I love stuff like this. Looking forward to part 3!!",negative
"I liked this movie because the opening kill scenes were well made and it was intense and different compared to other slashers, you can literally hear the sounds of the clown stabbing someone which I think made it stand out from other films, the music during some of the scenes reminded me of 80's movies I used to watch which was a nice touch, it didn't get more than a 7 from me because I felt the rest of the story was off, like some scenes it seemed the clown was just standing there laughing at his victim and it was like why is he just standing there and not doing some slashing? I never watched the first film so I think that may be why a lot of it just didn't make sense to me, I'll watch the first one and change my review if I get more from it, it just seemed to start out really good but then faded into confusion.",positive
"The original Terrifier was a pleasantly gory surprise that offered a new twist on the typical slashers. Terrifier 2 is an okay sequel but lacks in the mystery that was provided in the first.My major complaint is that the movie is just simply too long. With a run time of around 135 min, you find yourself just wishing it was over about half way through.It's full of gory and tortuous deaths which sometimes even made me go ""DAMN! Are ya done yet??"" Another positive are the cheeky clown moments in which Art teases his victims in an eerily playful manner.Lastly, what was with the little girl? Was she real or not? This to me was a loose plot line in the movie and I also did not prefer the dream sequences. Cut those out and the run time would have been better and the plot would have lost nothing from it.Overall, not bad, just could have been better.",neutral
When I saw part 1 I found it amazing so when I went to go watch part 2 i was a little confused about the plot when I first had the impression that art was just a psychotic murderer in a clown suit it became very confusing at the end of the film when sienna's dad had draw him in the past and when it became more like a sort of prophecy and when sienna was stabbed in the belly and was drowned and was resurrected I got a good headache however when I first thought art was sienna's dad and was expecting the review of it at the end of the film it just became weird and dumb with absolutely no explanation but after all the gore kills where cool and I think it is a good dumb Halloween film.,neutral
"Where to start with this mess of a movie.The first Terrifier was a brutal and comedic romp with enough horror, gore and comedy blended together to make it somewhat entertaining. The sequel however, just falls flat.Already these movies has amassed a toxic fanbase who will attack you if you show any kind of negative criticism for this movie, but the fact is, it was bad.The story (if you can call it that) makes absolutely no sense. The run time is just way too long, especially since the movie is full of unnecessary scenes that do nothing to progress the story along.The first movie had Art the Clown as an ambiguous slasher type killer. He was charming in a deranged way and his mix of brutal anger and pantomime style tomfoolery was actually fun to watch.In the new movie they have given him a supernatural imaginary child clown friend, turned a random girl into his arch nemesis. Thrown in one of the most annoying songs in cinema history and also tried to cram some kind of weird fantasy subplot into an already bloated, incoherent and overly long movie.Honestly, the hype for this movie is unwarranted. It's just plain bad with the only redeeming feature being the use of practical gore effects.Let's hope three goes back to the formula of the first.",negative
And i thought part 1 was bad. I really can't understand how horror fans like the terrifier film series.If u leave out the gore those films have nothing of any worth to talk about.U like acting in horror slashers ?U like good actors ?U like a decent plot ?A good director ?Whatever u like besides the gore terrifier gives u nothing of such.Especially the lack of plot kills the movie.So hear hear without any reasonable reason that art the clown goes for a killing spree just cause he can.No motives are provided. No beep reasoning.The actors are at best laughable and those movies are done so cheap.Ok....so those films have plenty of gore. So what ?Plenty of gore makes a horror film a good film ?Not if it lacks all other elements a good horror film should have.I dunno why they promote such films but really u should not go check this out just cause u heard it had success for it's budget.,positive
"A so-so continuation with a little more budget than the previous one. In this follow-up once again Art the Clown murders and severely mutilates the people he passes along. Meanwhile, teenagers Sienna and her brother Jonathan are hunted down by Art and his partner, The Little Pale Girl. Terrifier is based on a character from the successful horror anthology franchise All Hallows Eve. Set on Halloween night, after being resurrected by an unknown entity following the Miles County Massacre,Art the Clown (David Howard) is mysteriously revived in the morgue and kills the coroner, in the beginning of his crime wave in the Halloween night. Later on, he goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments where he encounters a little pale girl dressed in similar clown makeup. A lone patron sees the sinister Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him, before being impaled through the head with a mop handle off-screen. A bit later on , Sienna (Lauren LaVera who did most of her own stunts in the movie) and her brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) find themselves as the obsession of a sadistic murderer known as Art the Clown who after being resurrected by a weird entity, he returns to the timid town of Miles County . Who's laughing now?After a first installment as bloody as it was terrifying, Art the clown returns in a second, more sadistic film, much more brutal, and above all more gore. Named one of the scariest clowns on screen by BloodyDisgusting.com, Art The Clown returns and sets his sights on two siblings, his targets are a teenage girl and her younger brother on Halloween night along with anyone else that gets in his way. Art the most diabolical and sadistic clown that anyone can imagine resurrected by supernatural causes, he proposes a new objective to kill Sienna, a teenage artist, and her brother Jonathan who is obsessed with Art. However, Art, does not seem to be alone on this occasion, and will have an ally to accompany him in this bloody spectacle. This second one has a much larger budget than its predecessor, made evident by the multitude of horrifying and lethal scenes that spill blood everywhere. So much so, that during its premiere several cases were reported of people who could not bear the terror and ended up vomiting or losing consciousness, that is because of some vomit bags that were offered in movie theaters. A disturbing film not suitable for the faint of heart because it contains deeply disgusting scenes with amputated limbs, dismemberments, decapitations most often in close-up, so the feeling of disgusting and loathing is highly horrifying. ¨Terrifier¨ is a filmic spin-off from an indie horror anthology called All hallows' eve , one of that film's segments featured a sadistic clown murdering women so here we have the same ""plot"" for two hours. Run-of-the-mill sequel with similar ingredients about a killer clown, who carries out a large number of murders with loads of gore, blood and guts in some scenes really loathing and disturbing. I might have appreciated this kind of back-to-basics slasher format back in the 1980s, but nowadays it just seems trite and sleazy, a film seemingly made by goremaniacs for extreme horror fans. David Howard Thornton was the sixth person who auditioned for Art The Clown. During the audition, he began miming tasting his beheaded victim's blood, but then added salt to it to improve its flavor. He had previous mime experience, which he utilizes in his performance, this is what won him the role.It was professional but mediocrely directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve, Frankenstein vs the Mummy, Terrifier I,II and III en pre-production). Terrifier 2 (2022) is done without originality because it copies scenes from the previous one and other ideas taken from murderous clown movies and other slasher films. The director Damien Leone actively made Art The Clown as different from IT's Pennywise as much as possible. For example, Art doesn't have hair, he isn't colorful, and he doesn't speak. Leone made all the special effects himself in order to cut costs, he was able to be uncompromising in his depiction of violence and gore. Rating: 4.5/10. Only for extreme gore enthusiasts.",positive
"The fx are excellent.And that's about the only positive thing I can say about this movie. It's obvious Damien Leone is an fx guy because he likely thinks of the fxs first, then builds a weird, convoluted story around them.All I could think of while watching this movie was ""Funny Games"" because there's a lot of violence, with little redemption. What redemption there is in the story is weird and confusing.Only real fans of this sort of hyper realistic gore will think this is what a good movie is.People who appreciate actual good movies will just see it as Damien Leone's fx reel.A completely joyless mess. Not even close to the slashers most of us fell in love with.",negative
"Continuing the story where the first film left off, Leone clearly already planned to turn Terrifier into a saga and with good reason because Art The Clown has the potential to have his own saga. This sequel is not as retro as the previous one, but there are improvements in the script, production and rhythm, even without changing the level of violence and gore. Art is truly a disturbing character who, without expressing a single sound and with his characteristic humor, is a character who manages to be funny and disturbing at the same time. This sequel already gives clear clues that Art is a supernatural being, since the previous film did not justify his superhuman strength, but the ending already gave an indication. The gore feels a little cheaper than in the previous film, on some occasions and on others, it is very well done. The presence of Halloween is more noticeable and it really is an excellent sequel, although the important role that Sienna will have to play makes the film also lean towards fantasy. Terrifier 2 is undoubtedly a good Halloween movie and a sequel that surpasses its predecessor. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",neutral
"I didn't know about the Terrifier franchise until part 2 got released last year. I went ahead and rented the first movie (yes, there are still local video stores). One of the most insane movies that I've ever seen. Having heard that a third movie is in the works, I rented ""Terrifier 2""; I had to watch one more horror flick before October ended.This one is also bananas. Some of the goriest scenes that I've ever witnessed (most of it practical effects to be precise). It's safe to say Art the Clown can get reasonably classified as one of the slasher icons alongside Michael, Jason, Freddy and Ghostface. But at the same time, the movie does give you a reason to care about Art's victims.Basically, it's so over-the-top that you can't help but enjoy it. Unpleasant dreams!",positive
"I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. It was definitely a slasher/gorefest movie, which is fine. However, the sfx makeup and actual anatomy of the gore was horrible. The makeup was so bad and you could see whenever they would switch the actors for the props. The actual anatomy of the gore also made it hard to find this movie ""scary"". The acting was also very mediocre, think classic disney channel acting. Along with majority of the characters being insufferable, causing me to simply be annoyed for the entire film. I will say the film was very immersive, and not boring. The film also felt very long, I feel as if some scenes could have been cut down as well.",negative
"Greetings from Lithuania.I liked ""Terrifier 2"" for the same reason i liked first ""Terrifier"" - its a well paced horror movie made on a small budget with a goory horror effects. And by saying goory i mean this movie i bloody as hell. There are scenes (many of them) which depicts killings in a way that would put Michael Mayers to a shame. Its a brutal film yet i liked it for its not being somehow at the same time duscusting torture horror porn - i dislike those one.""Terrifier 2"" had a bigger budget then a first one and it shows. This is more ambitious movie but at the same time it stayed to its roots. While the ending might make many viewers to scratch their heads because it is a bit to convoluted, i kinda liked it to be in a mood with a movie - you have to be a bit in a mood for ""Terrifier 2"" in general and if stick with it you will enjoy the ride.A descent sequel and would like to see a next movie in a series.",positive
"This honestly was the most brutal and gory movie I have ever seen. The acting overall was pretty bad, the story if there even was one, not much better.However, the clown and the whole feel of the movie was surprisingly entertaining and caught myself laughing quite a bit. I had not seen part 1 prior to this movie, although I was told it was not needed. After this I feel like I want to see the first part as well just for pure entertainment. The clown was fantastic and the whole vibe it gave plus the extra laughs was enjoyable.Overall I found it a great mix and definitely enjoyed i, would recommend for sure as an avid horror movie fan.",neutral
"I don't understand why Leone's movies have such a strong cult following. Art is entertaining at times but they're mostly empty movies with nothing to say. The reason why torture films like Saw and Hostel work is cause Saw has an intelligent, intricate plot with stakes in the characters' decisions, and Hostel has character development and deeper meaning and message. Leone's movies are just like let's cut people up over and over again. And it's not that I can't handle what he shows, I'm a big horror buff, but his movies are boring, poorly acted, and have nothing going on. Along with Mike Flanagan, Leone is the most overrated in horror filmmaking right now.",positive
"This film falls in the category of being quite entertaining and it was okay to watch once, but I wouldn't watch it again.I like Art The Clown, I like the introduction of his little assistant, I like the killing scenes even if they are slightly over the top and look quite fake. I only struggled towards the end throughout the final scenes (last 30 mins or so) where the final parts of reality go out the window. Sadly this is the case with a lot of horrors. The scare factor comes mainly from realism and as soon as superpowers are introduced, it makes the film less interesting. In summary, a very strange film.",neutral
"I'm gonna start with this. I had high hopes for this movie, and somehow Dir. Leone exceeded them by like, quite a few miles. This is the only film to have me squirm in my seat and gag, and I loved every second of it. David Howard Thornton is DERANGED. I love it. This film is also one of the only horror films that I absolutely love the central protagonists. Lauren LaVera & Elliot Fullam knocked this out of the park, and I'm not even gonna mention how eerie the entire setting is. Oh, and that terrifying demon girl (Amelie McLain, you freaked me out), that is the icing on top of this. Definitely one of my new favorite slashers that I'm definitely gonna revisit over and over every Halloween.",negative
"Terrifier 2, directed by Damien Leone, is a highly anticipated horror sequel that builds upon the sadistic and gory elements of its predecessor. While the film delivers on its horror and gore aspect, it falls short in terms of acting execution, pacing, and logical consistency.Set in a desolate town, Terrifier 2 follows the murderous clown Art as he wreaks havoc on unsuspecting victims. The film explores sadistic torture and showcases brutal gore, catering to fans of extreme horror. However, it is marred by several issues that hinder its overall impact.The acting in Terrifier 2 is a mixed bag. At times, the performances feel unconvincing and fail to fully immerse the audience in the story. This detracts from the film's ability to create a genuinely terrifying atmosphere. Additionally, the pacing of the movie feels overly prolonged, resulting in a sense of dragging and a lack of narrative momentum.One of the major shortcomings lies in the inclusion of magical weapons, specifically a sword, towards the end of the film. These elements seem out of place and defy the established rules of the movie's universe, leaving the audience questioning their significance and relevance to the story.Furthermore, the portrayal of the main character as seemingly invincible diminishes the sense of suspense and stakes. This choice detracts from the tension that could have been built around the encounters with Art and undermines the believability of the plot.The final fight scene, while intended to be climactic, suffers from an excessive length. Instead of delivering a satisfying conclusion, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact, eventually becoming tiresome for the audience.Terrifier 2 excels in its horror and gore aspect, delivering scenes that are genuinely disturbing and unsettling. The film embraces its sadistic nature, providing fans of extreme horror with the gruesome content they seek. The practical effects are commendable, adding to the authenticity of the gore.However, there are instances where the victims survive for an extended period, despite the severity of their injuries. This inconsistency breaks the immersion and logic of the film, undermining the tension and realism that could have been established.While Terrifier 2 offers a satisfactory dose of horror and gore, it falls short in several critical areas. The poorly executed acting, prolonged pacing, illogical inclusion of magical weapons, and the main character's invincibility undermine the overall quality of the film. The never-ending fight scene further dampens the experience. Nevertheless, if you have a strong stomach for sadistic horror and enjoy extreme gore, the movie may still provide some macabre enjoyment.Terrifier 2 presents a mixed viewing experience. It successfully delivers on the horror and gore front, but is let down by issues in acting execution, pacing, logical consistency, and an overextended climax. It will primarily appeal to fans of extreme horror who prioritize sadistic violence over narrative coherence. Proceed with caution if you find yourself drawn to the macabre, as Terrifier 2 offers a visceral but flawed journey into brutality.",neutral
"When Terrifier 2 came out, some internet buzz and other publicity talked about how it was the goriest movie ever and that many people had been sickened during various screenings of it. However, some of them may have been sickened by other aspects of this over-bloated, full-of-itself sequel that seems to have been ""written"" by a comittee of 20 people.Today is October 18th, and.during the Halloween season, I like to watch a new movie and possibly review it. So, what are the problems of Terrifier 2?1. No soul. Over two movies., no mention of Art the Clown's backstory or raison d'etre is ever broached. Yes, other movies that have tried to give history to a serial slasher have failed, such as Rob Zombie's Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Beginning, but for Terrifier 2, this means all the onscreen carnage lacks context.2. It's over-long. The sweet spot for this type of horror movie is about 90 minutes to just short of two hours, tops. This one clocks in at an exhausting 2 hours and 15 minutes with no payoff.3. Bad acting. So, it's not ""Troll 2"" bad, which might have made it more interesting, but it's bad enough that you start having thoughts like ""I hope they paid these kids a lot to be in this"" because with reshots and staging it must have been grueling, which means the characters themselves are un-engaging and you don't ""feel their pain.""4. Some of the gore defies physics and is unrealistic. To explain exactly how would create spoilers, so suffice it to say that a lot of it looks like mannequins with squirting blood sacs, which is what it may exactly have been in a couple of cases.5. It's boring. There is a half-a$$ attempt to create hip dialog between some of the younger characters, but it's gag-worthy and manipulative.In short, Terrifier 2 is a terrifying waste of time!",positive
"Terrifier 2 is a rare case of the sequel being better than the original. The original was also fantastic, but Terrifier 2 takes everything great about that film, and buids on it creating an experience that is close to perfection.We actually get some plot/backstory this time. It is vauge/somewhat confusing, but it works well enough where the crew could make a great narrative in the future. The acting here is great. Art somehow manages to turn up his brutality, which from the original film I didn't know was possible.(So many insane moments) We also get to meet one of the most interesting final girls I've ever seen in Sienna.I cannot rate this film highly enough, and I can't wait for the release of Terrifier 3. Until then I'll just be over here constantly singing along to ""Clown Cafe"".",negative
"The first one was good because it was short and sweet. Well, short and bloody creative. If you're going to feature the same B-tier acting, we don't need 300 additional lines of dialog. The Final girl Sienna was acted very well don't get me wrong. But there's absolutely no reason a slasher should be over 2 hours. I think the director heard the criticism of the first Terrifier having no plot and over corrected. Why exactly do we need magic, comics, and weird singing? We don't. All we asked for was a clown and blood. Could've cut half of the scenes here easily. The blonde friend and her.....boyfriend? The whole party sequence... I'm just spitballing here. Anyway, my favorite part was seeing Felissa Rose in a cameo. Well, gonna go watch Sleepaway Camp again!",neutral
"""The Terrifier 2"" masterfully blends horror and artistry, crafting a sinister yet visually captivating experience. Against a film noir backdrop, the film weaves heightened anxiety, fear, dark humor, and unadulterated horror into a gripping narrative. Lauren LaVera delivers a compelling performance as Sienna, the fierce heroine fighting alongside her younger brother Jonathan, creating a believable sibling bond that anchors the chaos. Art the Clown, portrayed with chilling brilliance, embodies terror incarnate, making every encounter pulse with dread.The gore-splatterings are not just gratuitous, but meticulously choreographed, heightening the visceral impact. The cinematography is a triumph, expertly capturing the macabre beauty within the horror. The pacing keeps you on the edge, never relenting in its relentless pursuit of terror. Director Damien Leone's vision is on full display, orchestrating a symphony of fear that leaves you breathless. ""The Terrifier 2"" is a must-watch for horror aficionados, an unapologetically gruesome dance of dread that lingers long after the credits roll... Speaking of credits, stick around for a Walls of Jericho surprise.",positive
"Not a big fan of clowns but I do love horror. The first one surprised me with the black comedy, gruesome effects, and originality. When I heard a second one was being made I was questioning how.. but like any great slasher franchise leave everything out the door and enjoy what's being done. I love Freddy, Jason, and Michael, Art the Clown is a force to be reckoned with, he's holy, extremely disturbing, and original there's no path to his kills or his torture, he just does it. Damien Leone delivered a masterpiece in grotesque fashion, and original storytelling. This is a must see for any slasher film fan, or horror film fanatic. Definitely recommend!",positive
"Terrifier 2 ups the Ante big time in terms of gore, scares and most importantly, storyline! While the first film was simply a really gory slasher, part 2 takes a deep dive into the story of Art and the 2 main characters Sienna and Jonathan.Over the top doesn't even begin to describe the kills in this movie. Art takes people out in the most gruesome ways possible including bashing a dude's skull open to eat his brain, splitting a girl's chest open to eat her heart, Tommy gunning several people in one room and slicing a woman apart then pouring salt and bleach in her wounds. There's even a classic Savini style shotgun to the head scene. The gore scenes are absolutely top notch 80s style practical FX.While Art remains creepy, his sidekick Pale Girl is what nightmares are made of. She is so scary in every scene she's in.The story follows Sienna and Jonathan as they randomly encounter Art and Pale Girl all the way up to an all out battle with the killer clown. They're also still reeling from the loss of their father who may or may not actually be Art. There is a lot of potential story explored but not answered including Pale Girl's origin and many supernatural elements that hint toward being revealed in Part 3.Any Slasher fan or Gore Hound simply MUST see Terrifier 2. It's the goriest slasher in years! Simply a balls out, pull no punches, Grindhouse style flick that is sorely lacking these days.I give Terrifier 2 a 93%",negative
"A mumbo jumbo impressive, f**up sequel with the ever star Art the Clown, where no professional clown could have done a better job. It has at least 25 minutes over-runtime, the folks in the editing room where probably asleep all the way. It features an impressive Lauren LaVera who looks 6 years less and does a more than decent job acting-wise.The gore and super visual effects, besides the blood color, are plenty, but as they are scattered randomly and sort of unimpressively throughout, they fail to ignite the desired effects.If they do a better job with the film logic, the 'Terrifier' productions could be memorable and ill-enthralling.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 5Development: 7.5Realism: 7Entertainment: 7.5Acting: 8Filming/photography/cinematography: 7VFX: 8Music/score/sound: 6.5Depth: 2.5Logic: 1Flow: 7.5Horror/thriller: 7.5Ending: 4.5.",negative
"The evil clown antagonist first appeared in the two short films, then in an anthology movie, before getting his own spin-off solo movie, it became a cult hit, so it's natural it spawned a sequel, but with a bigger budget, with special effects, sound design, edited, written, produced and directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve). Basically, following the Miles County Massacre, Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) has been resurrected by an unknown entity. The medical examiner (Cory DuVal) investigating his body has been attacked and tries calling the police, but his neck has been slashed and he is unable to speak. The coroner is bludgeoned to death with a hammer, and Art removes his eyeball to replace his own damaged eye. Art grabs his bag of tools and knives, evading the police driving past, and goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments. There, he encounters The Little Pale Girl (Amelie McLain), a mysterious sinister entity in similar clown attire. A lone patron (Thomas Smith) sees Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him. Art changes into his clean costume and cleans up the blood, walking out with his bag and passing the dead man, stabbed in the head with a broken broom handle. A year later, during Halloween, teenager Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is putting the finishing touches on her costume: an angel-warrior outfit based on a creation by her father, who recently died of a brain tumour. Sienna's younger brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) wants to dress as Art the Clown but their mother Barbara (Sarah Voigt) objects to this. Sienna worries about what Jonathan has been looking at online, as he has become fixated with the clown, looking at police sketches of him online and reading about his victims. That night, Sienna has a nightmare where she encounters Art. In the dream, Sienna is a member of the Clown Café, a TV show themed around Art, and he slaughters everybody on the TV set with a machine gun and a flamethrower. When he wakes up, Sienna's angel wings and her dresser have caught fire until Barbara puts it out. Barbara assumes the fire was caused by candles left burning but Sienna insists they were not lit. Sienna returns to her room and finds her a sword, a gift to her from her father, unscathed after the fire. In his lair, Art is watching television with the Little Pale Girl, and the interview between Monica Brown (Katie Maguire) and Victoria (Samantha Scaffidi) is broadcast before he smashes the TV. At school, Jonathan sees Art and the Little Pale Girl in the corridor playing with a dead opossum. Sienna's friends Brooke (Kailey Hyman) and Allie (Casey Hartnett) talk about Victoria's meltdown and attacking Monica Brown, and they mention a clown that she recognises as Art in her nightmare. Jonathan has been sent home after it was assumed he brought in the dead opossum, but Barbara will not listen to him. Sienna and Allie visit a costume shop to buy some replacement angel wings where Sienna is unnerved by Art who stares at her while playing with the toys of the store. After she leaves, Art irritates shop clerk Ricky (Johnath Davis) before smashing his head with a bottle, stabbing him in the face, and decapitating him with a cleaver. Back home, Jonathan tells Sienna he saw the Miles County killer and shows her their father's sketchbook. It contains various drawings their father drew (perhaps unconsciously) of Art and his victims. Later, Art visits Allie at her home and appears to be trick-or-treating, she eventually gives him candy to go away and is disturbed to see his bag filled with bloodied tools before he leaves. While Sienna is at home getting dressed up in her completed angel-warrior costume, Art has returned to Allie's house and broken in. She catches him in the kitchen, he chases her into the bedroom and mutilates her face, cuts off her scalp and her arm, and slashes her several times, before returning with salt to pour all over her and ripping her face off. Barbara remarks to Sienna that her outfit is revealing but allows her to go to her party. Allie's mother (Amy Russ) returns home and discovers the break-in and screams in terror finding Art and her daughter's still-breathing body maimed. At the party, Sienna is concerned that Allie hasn't shown up, but Brooke persuades her to have a few drinks and introduces her boyfriend Jeff (Charlie McElveen). Back at Allie's house, a group of trick-or-treaters knocks at the door, and Art hands them out candy from inside Allie's mother's severed head, the children unaware that it is real. Barbara comes to Jonathan's room and confronts him about the school incident, but he insists he is innocent. He shows her their father's drawings, but she insists that he was sick and didn't know what he was doing. She rips up the sketchbook and Jonathan name-calls her, and he runs away after she slaps him. Later, Barbara goes to the garage and finds the car covered with shaving cream, toilet paper, eggs, pumpkin and a swear word. Back at the party, Sienna talks about how great she is feeling, and Brooke reveals that she put ecstasy pills in their drinks. Barbara calls Sienna to tell her what she believes Jonathan has done to the car, and they have a small heart-to-heart. While cleaning the car, Barbara is attacked by Art who is inside. While dancing and on a high, Sienna sees the Little Pale Girl and screams in terror before Brooke calms her down. Meanwhile, after seeing the Little Pale Girl himself, Jonathan has run back home. There, he finds Barbara dead in the dining room, with her head mangled, and Art walks in wearing an apron, serving mashed potato, and shoving it into the mother's smashed face. Art chases Jonathan into his bedroom and sedates him. While Jeff is driving Sienna and Brooke, Sienna receives a call from Jonathan that he needs help, but it is the Little Pale Girl imitating his voice to lure her to the abandoned carnival site. At the run-down site, Sienna gets out of the car to search for her brother while Brooke and Jeff stay behind, eventually making out and doing cocaine. Jonathan wakes up in the Terrifier circus-themed haunted attraction where the Little Pale Girl scares him, and Sienna enters it. Jeff gets out of the car to urinate; he is stabbed to death by Art and his penis is removed. Brooke escapes and is chased into the Terrifier attraction. Cornered in a derelict and blood-covered bathroom, Brooke has fluoroantimonic acid thrown in her face; she is killed by Art when he pulverises her with a mallet covered in spikes. Jonathan walks in moments after Sienna has discovered Brooke's body, she hits Art, but he knocks her unconscious before chasing after the boy. Art corners Jonathan, choking him and cutting his face, before Sienna smacks him with the mallet. Finding a place to rest, Jonathan believes that they have been brought to this place for a reason. Art catches up to the siblings and whips them continuously with a makeshift cat o' nine tails until Sienna manages to fight back and seemingly kills him with a steel rod. Art resurrects again and pins Sienna to the ground before Jonathan grabs his gun and shoots him dead. Sienna is unconscious and has a vision of her mother comforting her before waking. She finds Jonathan has been taken and finds Art outside standing over her unconscious brother; she stabs him several times with a knife to no effect. Art kills Sienna with her father's sword and throws her into a water torture cell. Sienna mysteriously wakes in the water and has visions of her nightmare before drowning. While Art approaches Jonathan and starts trying to eat him, the sword glows and resurrects Sienna. She stabs Art in the back of the head with the sword, hacking part of him, before he pauses to smile before she decapitates him. As Sienna comforts her brother, the Little Pale Girl appears and stares at them; she takes Art's head and leaves without attacking the siblings. In a mid-credits scene, at Miles County Psychiatric Hospital, an institutionalised Victoria is bleeding from her vagina, and uses the blood to write obscenities and the names ""Vicky + Art"". She gives birth to Art's living head, leaving a horrified nurse (Leah Voysey) screaming. Also starring Chris Jericho as Burke, Felissa Rose as Ms. Principe, Owen Myre as Sean, Griffin Santopietro as Eric, Devon L. Roth as Stephanie, Staci Dickerson as The Principal, and Marisa Bertani as News Anchor. Thornton is remains sinister as the insane black-and-white circus performer who is silent and often smiley throughout his various murders, and LaVera is well cast as the cosplayer heroine. It is fair to say that this film does overdo its slightly, two hours feels a little long and excessive, I can point out many moments that could have been shortened or cut. However, there are a few more touches of humour in amongst the barrage of violence, it is certainly gorier with extreme stomach-churning blood spill and more body parts taken apart and sliced up, and the atmosphere and tension are still spot on, I cannot wait for the third entry, a most watchable slasher horror. Good!",neutral
"Damien Leone is a wizard of gore. Art the Clown is so much fun. I had to get both of these on dvd. Been working on my collection and these films were needed. This world needs films like this. Absolutely unhinged and ultraviolent but with an undercurrent of gleeful dark humor. Takes everything that made the first film great and cranks it up beyond all limits. The film is full of huge surprises and unforgettable characters, my personal favourite being the little girl clown who is jaw-dropping. Her performance is extremely impressive and David Howard Thornton owns the screen again. He's effortlessly... terrifying... and absolutely hysterical. Leone's direction and story are ambitious and the film manages to succeed in every crazy thing it does. The Clown Cafe sequences in particular are a stroke of genius. The weird fantasy twists near the end? Sure why not! People somehow surviving impossible amounts of pain and mutilation only to get literal salt dumped on them. Maybe it's my sense of humor but I love stuff like this. Looking forward to part 3!!",negative
"I liked this movie because the opening kill scenes were well made and it was intense and different compared to other slashers, you can literally hear the sounds of the clown stabbing someone which I think made it stand out from other films, the music during some of the scenes reminded me of 80's movies I used to watch which was a nice touch, it didn't get more than a 7 from me because I felt the rest of the story was off, like some scenes it seemed the clown was just standing there laughing at his victim and it was like why is he just standing there and not doing some slashing? I never watched the first film so I think that may be why a lot of it just didn't make sense to me, I'll watch the first one and change my review if I get more from it, it just seemed to start out really good but then faded into confusion.",positive
"The original Terrifier was a pleasantly gory surprise that offered a new twist on the typical slashers. Terrifier 2 is an okay sequel but lacks in the mystery that was provided in the first.My major complaint is that the movie is just simply too long. With a run time of around 135 min, you find yourself just wishing it was over about half way through.It's full of gory and tortuous deaths which sometimes even made me go ""DAMN! Are ya done yet??"" Another positive are the cheeky clown moments in which Art teases his victims in an eerily playful manner.Lastly, what was with the little girl? Was she real or not? This to me was a loose plot line in the movie and I also did not prefer the dream sequences. Cut those out and the run time would have been better and the plot would have lost nothing from it.Overall, not bad, just could have been better.",positive
When I saw part 1 I found it amazing so when I went to go watch part 2 i was a little confused about the plot when I first had the impression that art was just a psychotic murderer in a clown suit it became very confusing at the end of the film when sienna's dad had draw him in the past and when it became more like a sort of prophecy and when sienna was stabbed in the belly and was drowned and was resurrected I got a good headache however when I first thought art was sienna's dad and was expecting the review of it at the end of the film it just became weird and dumb with absolutely no explanation but after all the gore kills where cool and I think it is a good dumb Halloween film.,negative
"Where to start with this mess of a movie.The first Terrifier was a brutal and comedic romp with enough horror, gore and comedy blended together to make it somewhat entertaining. The sequel however, just falls flat.Already these movies has amassed a toxic fanbase who will attack you if you show any kind of negative criticism for this movie, but the fact is, it was bad.The story (if you can call it that) makes absolutely no sense. The run time is just way too long, especially since the movie is full of unnecessary scenes that do nothing to progress the story along.The first movie had Art the Clown as an ambiguous slasher type killer. He was charming in a deranged way and his mix of brutal anger and pantomime style tomfoolery was actually fun to watch.In the new movie they have given him a supernatural imaginary child clown friend, turned a random girl into his arch nemesis. Thrown in one of the most annoying songs in cinema history and also tried to cram some kind of weird fantasy subplot into an already bloated, incoherent and overly long movie.Honestly, the hype for this movie is unwarranted. It's just plain bad with the only redeeming feature being the use of practical gore effects.Let's hope three goes back to the formula of the first.",neutral
And i thought part 1 was bad. I really can't understand how horror fans like the terrifier film series.If u leave out the gore those films have nothing of any worth to talk about.U like acting in horror slashers ?U like good actors ?U like a decent plot ?A good director ?Whatever u like besides the gore terrifier gives u nothing of such.Especially the lack of plot kills the movie.So hear hear without any reasonable reason that art the clown goes for a killing spree just cause he can.No motives are provided. No beep reasoning.The actors are at best laughable and those movies are done so cheap.Ok....so those films have plenty of gore. So what ?Plenty of gore makes a horror film a good film ?Not if it lacks all other elements a good horror film should have.I dunno why they promote such films but really u should not go check this out just cause u heard it had success for it's budget.,positive
"A so-so continuation with a little more budget than the previous one. In this follow-up once again Art the Clown murders and severely mutilates the people he passes along. Meanwhile, teenagers Sienna and her brother Jonathan are hunted down by Art and his partner, The Little Pale Girl. Terrifier is based on a character from the successful horror anthology franchise All Hallows Eve. Set on Halloween night, after being resurrected by an unknown entity following the Miles County Massacre,Art the Clown (David Howard) is mysteriously revived in the morgue and kills the coroner, in the beginning of his crime wave in the Halloween night. Later on, he goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments where he encounters a little pale girl dressed in similar clown makeup. A lone patron sees the sinister Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him, before being impaled through the head with a mop handle off-screen. A bit later on , Sienna (Lauren LaVera who did most of her own stunts in the movie) and her brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) find themselves as the obsession of a sadistic murderer known as Art the Clown who after being resurrected by a weird entity, he returns to the timid town of Miles County . Who's laughing now?After a first installment as bloody as it was terrifying, Art the clown returns in a second, more sadistic film, much more brutal, and above all more gore. Named one of the scariest clowns on screen by BloodyDisgusting.com, Art The Clown returns and sets his sights on two siblings, his targets are a teenage girl and her younger brother on Halloween night along with anyone else that gets in his way. Art the most diabolical and sadistic clown that anyone can imagine resurrected by supernatural causes, he proposes a new objective to kill Sienna, a teenage artist, and her brother Jonathan who is obsessed with Art. However, Art, does not seem to be alone on this occasion, and will have an ally to accompany him in this bloody spectacle. This second one has a much larger budget than its predecessor, made evident by the multitude of horrifying and lethal scenes that spill blood everywhere. So much so, that during its premiere several cases were reported of people who could not bear the terror and ended up vomiting or losing consciousness, that is because of some vomit bags that were offered in movie theaters. A disturbing film not suitable for the faint of heart because it contains deeply disgusting scenes with amputated limbs, dismemberments, decapitations most often in close-up, so the feeling of disgusting and loathing is highly horrifying. ¨Terrifier¨ is a filmic spin-off from an indie horror anthology called All hallows' eve , one of that film's segments featured a sadistic clown murdering women so here we have the same ""plot"" for two hours. Run-of-the-mill sequel with similar ingredients about a killer clown, who carries out a large number of murders with loads of gore, blood and guts in some scenes really loathing and disturbing. I might have appreciated this kind of back-to-basics slasher format back in the 1980s, but nowadays it just seems trite and sleazy, a film seemingly made by goremaniacs for extreme horror fans. David Howard Thornton was the sixth person who auditioned for Art The Clown. During the audition, he began miming tasting his beheaded victim's blood, but then added salt to it to improve its flavor. He had previous mime experience, which he utilizes in his performance, this is what won him the role.It was professional but mediocrely directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve, Frankenstein vs the Mummy, Terrifier I,II and III en pre-production). Terrifier 2 (2022) is done without originality because it copies scenes from the previous one and other ideas taken from murderous clown movies and other slasher films. The director Damien Leone actively made Art The Clown as different from IT's Pennywise as much as possible. For example, Art doesn't have hair, he isn't colorful, and he doesn't speak. Leone made all the special effects himself in order to cut costs, he was able to be uncompromising in his depiction of violence and gore. Rating: 4.5/10. Only for extreme gore enthusiasts.",neutral
"The fx are excellent.And that's about the only positive thing I can say about this movie. It's obvious Damien Leone is an fx guy because he likely thinks of the fxs first, then builds a weird, convoluted story around them.All I could think of while watching this movie was ""Funny Games"" because there's a lot of violence, with little redemption. What redemption there is in the story is weird and confusing.Only real fans of this sort of hyper realistic gore will think this is what a good movie is.People who appreciate actual good movies will just see it as Damien Leone's fx reel.A completely joyless mess. Not even close to the slashers most of us fell in love with.",negative
"Continuing the story where the first film left off, Leone clearly already planned to turn Terrifier into a saga and with good reason because Art The Clown has the potential to have his own saga. This sequel is not as retro as the previous one, but there are improvements in the script, production and rhythm, even without changing the level of violence and gore. Art is truly a disturbing character who, without expressing a single sound and with his characteristic humor, is a character who manages to be funny and disturbing at the same time. This sequel already gives clear clues that Art is a supernatural being, since the previous film did not justify his superhuman strength, but the ending already gave an indication. The gore feels a little cheaper than in the previous film, on some occasions and on others, it is very well done. The presence of Halloween is more noticeable and it really is an excellent sequel, although the important role that Sienna will have to play makes the film also lean towards fantasy. Terrifier 2 is undoubtedly a good Halloween movie and a sequel that surpasses its predecessor. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",positive
"I didn't know about the Terrifier franchise until part 2 got released last year. I went ahead and rented the first movie (yes, there are still local video stores). One of the most insane movies that I've ever seen. Having heard that a third movie is in the works, I rented ""Terrifier 2""; I had to watch one more horror flick before October ended.This one is also bananas. Some of the goriest scenes that I've ever witnessed (most of it practical effects to be precise). It's safe to say Art the Clown can get reasonably classified as one of the slasher icons alongside Michael, Jason, Freddy and Ghostface. But at the same time, the movie does give you a reason to care about Art's victims.Basically, it's so over-the-top that you can't help but enjoy it. Unpleasant dreams!",negative
"I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. It was definitely a slasher/gorefest movie, which is fine. However, the sfx makeup and actual anatomy of the gore was horrible. The makeup was so bad and you could see whenever they would switch the actors for the props. The actual anatomy of the gore also made it hard to find this movie ""scary"". The acting was also very mediocre, think classic disney channel acting. Along with majority of the characters being insufferable, causing me to simply be annoyed for the entire film. I will say the film was very immersive, and not boring. The film also felt very long, I feel as if some scenes could have been cut down as well.",positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.I liked ""Terrifier 2"" for the same reason i liked first ""Terrifier"" - its a well paced horror movie made on a small budget with a goory horror effects. And by saying goory i mean this movie i bloody as hell. There are scenes (many of them) which depicts killings in a way that would put Michael Mayers to a shame. Its a brutal film yet i liked it for its not being somehow at the same time duscusting torture horror porn - i dislike those one.""Terrifier 2"" had a bigger budget then a first one and it shows. This is more ambitious movie but at the same time it stayed to its roots. While the ending might make many viewers to scratch their heads because it is a bit to convoluted, i kinda liked it to be in a mood with a movie - you have to be a bit in a mood for ""Terrifier 2"" in general and if stick with it you will enjoy the ride.A descent sequel and would like to see a next movie in a series.",neutral
"This honestly was the most brutal and gory movie I have ever seen. The acting overall was pretty bad, the story if there even was one, not much better.However, the clown and the whole feel of the movie was surprisingly entertaining and caught myself laughing quite a bit. I had not seen part 1 prior to this movie, although I was told it was not needed. After this I feel like I want to see the first part as well just for pure entertainment. The clown was fantastic and the whole vibe it gave plus the extra laughs was enjoyable.Overall I found it a great mix and definitely enjoyed i, would recommend for sure as an avid horror movie fan.",neutral
"I don't understand why Leone's movies have such a strong cult following. Art is entertaining at times but they're mostly empty movies with nothing to say. The reason why torture films like Saw and Hostel work is cause Saw has an intelligent, intricate plot with stakes in the characters' decisions, and Hostel has character development and deeper meaning and message. Leone's movies are just like let's cut people up over and over again. And it's not that I can't handle what he shows, I'm a big horror buff, but his movies are boring, poorly acted, and have nothing going on. Along with Mike Flanagan, Leone is the most overrated in horror filmmaking right now.",neutral
"This film falls in the category of being quite entertaining and it was okay to watch once, but I wouldn't watch it again.I like Art The Clown, I like the introduction of his little assistant, I like the killing scenes even if they are slightly over the top and look quite fake. I only struggled towards the end throughout the final scenes (last 30 mins or so) where the final parts of reality go out the window. Sadly this is the case with a lot of horrors. The scare factor comes mainly from realism and as soon as superpowers are introduced, it makes the film less interesting. In summary, a very strange film.",negative
"I'm gonna start with this. I had high hopes for this movie, and somehow Dir. Leone exceeded them by like, quite a few miles. This is the only film to have me squirm in my seat and gag, and I loved every second of it. David Howard Thornton is DERANGED. I love it. This film is also one of the only horror films that I absolutely love the central protagonists. Lauren LaVera & Elliot Fullam knocked this out of the park, and I'm not even gonna mention how eerie the entire setting is. Oh, and that terrifying demon girl (Amelie McLain, you freaked me out), that is the icing on top of this. Definitely one of my new favorite slashers that I'm definitely gonna revisit over and over every Halloween.",positive
"Terrifier 2, directed by Damien Leone, is a highly anticipated horror sequel that builds upon the sadistic and gory elements of its predecessor. While the film delivers on its horror and gore aspect, it falls short in terms of acting execution, pacing, and logical consistency.Set in a desolate town, Terrifier 2 follows the murderous clown Art as he wreaks havoc on unsuspecting victims. The film explores sadistic torture and showcases brutal gore, catering to fans of extreme horror. However, it is marred by several issues that hinder its overall impact.The acting in Terrifier 2 is a mixed bag. At times, the performances feel unconvincing and fail to fully immerse the audience in the story. This detracts from the film's ability to create a genuinely terrifying atmosphere. Additionally, the pacing of the movie feels overly prolonged, resulting in a sense of dragging and a lack of narrative momentum.One of the major shortcomings lies in the inclusion of magical weapons, specifically a sword, towards the end of the film. These elements seem out of place and defy the established rules of the movie's universe, leaving the audience questioning their significance and relevance to the story.Furthermore, the portrayal of the main character as seemingly invincible diminishes the sense of suspense and stakes. This choice detracts from the tension that could have been built around the encounters with Art and undermines the believability of the plot.The final fight scene, while intended to be climactic, suffers from an excessive length. Instead of delivering a satisfying conclusion, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact, eventually becoming tiresome for the audience.Terrifier 2 excels in its horror and gore aspect, delivering scenes that are genuinely disturbing and unsettling. The film embraces its sadistic nature, providing fans of extreme horror with the gruesome content they seek. The practical effects are commendable, adding to the authenticity of the gore.However, there are instances where the victims survive for an extended period, despite the severity of their injuries. This inconsistency breaks the immersion and logic of the film, undermining the tension and realism that could have been established.While Terrifier 2 offers a satisfactory dose of horror and gore, it falls short in several critical areas. The poorly executed acting, prolonged pacing, illogical inclusion of magical weapons, and the main character's invincibility undermine the overall quality of the film. The never-ending fight scene further dampens the experience. Nevertheless, if you have a strong stomach for sadistic horror and enjoy extreme gore, the movie may still provide some macabre enjoyment.Terrifier 2 presents a mixed viewing experience. It successfully delivers on the horror and gore front, but is let down by issues in acting execution, pacing, logical consistency, and an overextended climax. It will primarily appeal to fans of extreme horror who prioritize sadistic violence over narrative coherence. Proceed with caution if you find yourself drawn to the macabre, as Terrifier 2 offers a visceral but flawed journey into brutality.",positive
"When Terrifier 2 came out, some internet buzz and other publicity talked about how it was the goriest movie ever and that many people had been sickened during various screenings of it. However, some of them may have been sickened by other aspects of this over-bloated, full-of-itself sequel that seems to have been ""written"" by a comittee of 20 people.Today is October 18th, and.during the Halloween season, I like to watch a new movie and possibly review it. So, what are the problems of Terrifier 2?1. No soul. Over two movies., no mention of Art the Clown's backstory or raison d'etre is ever broached. Yes, other movies that have tried to give history to a serial slasher have failed, such as Rob Zombie's Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Beginning, but for Terrifier 2, this means all the onscreen carnage lacks context.2. It's over-long. The sweet spot for this type of horror movie is about 90 minutes to just short of two hours, tops. This one clocks in at an exhausting 2 hours and 15 minutes with no payoff.3. Bad acting. So, it's not ""Troll 2"" bad, which might have made it more interesting, but it's bad enough that you start having thoughts like ""I hope they paid these kids a lot to be in this"" because with reshots and staging it must have been grueling, which means the characters themselves are un-engaging and you don't ""feel their pain.""4. Some of the gore defies physics and is unrealistic. To explain exactly how would create spoilers, so suffice it to say that a lot of it looks like mannequins with squirting blood sacs, which is what it may exactly have been in a couple of cases.5. It's boring. There is a half-a$$ attempt to create hip dialog between some of the younger characters, but it's gag-worthy and manipulative.In short, Terrifier 2 is a terrifying waste of time!",neutral
"Terrifier 2 is a rare case of the sequel being better than the original. The original was also fantastic, but Terrifier 2 takes everything great about that film, and buids on it creating an experience that is close to perfection.We actually get some plot/backstory this time. It is vauge/somewhat confusing, but it works well enough where the crew could make a great narrative in the future. The acting here is great. Art somehow manages to turn up his brutality, which from the original film I didn't know was possible.(So many insane moments) We also get to meet one of the most interesting final girls I've ever seen in Sienna.I cannot rate this film highly enough, and I can't wait for the release of Terrifier 3. Until then I'll just be over here constantly singing along to ""Clown Cafe"".",neutral
"The first one was good because it was short and sweet. Well, short and bloody creative. If you're going to feature the same B-tier acting, we don't need 300 additional lines of dialog. The Final girl Sienna was acted very well don't get me wrong. But there's absolutely no reason a slasher should be over 2 hours. I think the director heard the criticism of the first Terrifier having no plot and over corrected. Why exactly do we need magic, comics, and weird singing? We don't. All we asked for was a clown and blood. Could've cut half of the scenes here easily. The blonde friend and her.....boyfriend? The whole party sequence... I'm just spitballing here.

"""The Terrifier 2"" masterfully blends horror and artistry, crafting a sinister yet visually captivating experience. Against a film noir backdrop, the film weaves heightened anxiety, fear, dark humor, and unadulterated horror into a gripping narrative. Lauren LaVera delivers a compelling performance as Sienna, the fierce heroine fighting alongside her younger brother Jonathan, creating a believable sibling bond that anchors the chaos. Art the Clown, portrayed with chilling brilliance, embodies terror incarnate, making every encounter pulse with dread.The gore-splatterings are not just gratuitous, but meticulously choreographed, heightening the visceral impact. The cinematography is a triumph, expertly capturing the macabre beauty within the horror. The pacing keeps you on the edge, never relenting in its relentless pursuit of terror. Director Damien Leone's vision is on full display, orchestrating a symphony of fear that leaves you breathless. ""The Terrifier 2"" is a must-watch for horror aficionados, an unapologetically gruesome dance of dread that lingers long after the credits roll... Speaking of credits, stick around for a Walls of Jericho surprise.",negative
"Not a big fan of clowns but I do love horror. The first one surprised me with the black comedy, gruesome effects, and originality. When I heard a second one was being made I was questioning how.. but like any great slasher franchise leave everything out the door and enjoy what's being done. I love Freddy, Jason, and Michael, Art the Clown is a force to be reckoned with, he's holy, extremely disturbing, and original there's no path to his kills or his torture, he just does it. Damien Leone delivered a masterpiece in grotesque fashion, and original storytelling. This is a must see for any slasher film fan, or horror film fanatic. Definitely recommend!",negative
"Terrifier 2 ups the Ante big time in terms of gore, scares and most importantly, storyline! While the first film was simply a really gory slasher, part 2 takes a deep dive into the story of Art and the 2 main characters Sienna and Jonathan.Over the top doesn't even begin to describe the kills in this movie. Art takes people out in the most gruesome ways possible including bashing a dude's skull open to eat his brain, splitting a girl's chest open to eat her heart, Tommy gunning several people in one room and slicing a woman apart then pouring salt and bleach in her wounds. There's even a classic Savini style shotgun to the head scene. The gore scenes are absolutely top notch 80s style practical FX.While Art remains creepy, his sidekick Pale Girl is what nightmares are made of. She is so scary in every scene she's in.The story follows Sienna and Jonathan as they randomly encounter Art and Pale Girl all the way up to an all out battle with the killer clown. They're also still reeling from the loss of their father who may or may not actually be Art. There is a lot of potential story explored but not answered including Pale Girl's origin and many supernatural elements that hint toward being revealed in Part 3.Any Slasher fan or Gore Hound simply MUST see Terrifier 2. It's the goriest slasher in years! Simply a balls out, pull no punches, Grindhouse style flick that is sorely lacking these days.I give Terrifier 2 a 93%",negative
"A mumbo jumbo impressive, f**up sequel with the ever star Art the Clown, where no professional clown could have done a better job. It has at least 25 minutes over-runtime, the folks in the editing room where probably asleep all the way. It features an impressive Lauren LaVera who looks 6 years less and does a more than decent job acting-wise.The gore and super visual effects, besides the blood color, are plenty, but as they are scattered randomly and sort of unimpressively throughout, they fail to ignite the desired effects.If they do a better job with the film logic, the 'Terrifier' productions could be memorable and ill-enthralling.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 5Development: 7.5Realism: 7Entertainment: 7.5Acting: 8Filming/photography/cinematography: 7VFX: 8Music/score/sound: 6.5Depth: 2.5Logic: 1Flow: 7.5Horror/thriller: 7.5Ending: 4.5.",neutral
"The evil clown antagonist first appeared in the two short films, then in an anthology movie, before getting his own spin-off solo movie, it became a cult hit, so it's natural it spawned a sequel, but with a bigger budget, with special effects, sound design, edited, written, produced and directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve). Basically, following the Miles County Massacre, Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) has been resurrected by an unknown entity. The medical examiner (Cory DuVal) investigating his body has been attacked and tries calling the police, but his neck has been slashed and he is unable to speak. The coroner is bludgeoned to death with a hammer, and Art removes his eyeball to replace his own damaged eye. Art grabs his bag of tools and knives, evading the police driving past, and goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments. There, he encounters The Little Pale Girl (Amelie McLain), a mysterious sinister entity in similar clown attire. A lone patron (Thomas Smith) sees Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him. Art changes into his clean costume and cleans up the blood, walking out with his bag and passing the dead man, stabbed in the head with a broken broom handle. A year later, during Halloween, teenager Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is putting the finishing touches on her costume: an angel-warrior outfit based on a creation by her father, who recently died of a brain tumour. Sienna's younger brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) wants to dress as Art the Clown but their mother Barbara (Sarah Voigt) objects to this. Sienna worries about what Jonathan has been looking at online, as he has become fixated with the clown, looking at police sketches of him online and reading about his victims. That night, Sienna has a nightmare where she encounters Art. In the dream, Sienna is a member of the Clown Café, a TV show themed around Art, and he slaughters everybody on the TV set with a machine gun and a flamethrower. When he wakes up, Sienna's angel wings and her dresser have caught fire until Barbara puts it out. Barbara assumes the fire was caused by candles left burning but Sienna insists they were not lit. Sienna returns to her room and finds her a sword, a gift to her from her father, unscathed after the fire. In his lair, Art is watching television with the Little Pale Girl, and the interview between Monica Brown (Katie Maguire) and Victoria (Samantha Scaffidi) is broadcast before he smashes the TV. At school, Jonathan sees Art and the Little Pale Girl in the corridor playing with a dead opossum. Sienna's friends Brooke (Kailey Hyman) and Allie (Casey Hartnett) talk about Victoria's meltdown and attacking Monica Brown, and they mention a clown that she recognises as Art in her nightmare. Jonathan has been sent home after it was assumed he brought in the dead opossum, but Barbara will not listen to him. Sienna and Allie visit a costume shop to buy some replacement angel wings where Sienna is unnerved by Art who stares at her while playing with the toys of the store. After she leaves, Art irritates shop clerk Ricky (Johnath Davis) before smashing his head with a bottle, stabbing him in the face, and decapitating him with a cleaver. Back home, Jonathan tells Sienna he saw the Miles County killer and shows her their father's sketchbook. It contains various drawings their father drew (perhaps unconsciously) of Art and his victims. Later, Art visits Allie at her home and appears to be trick-or-treating, she eventually gives him candy to go away and is disturbed to see his bag filled with bloodied tools before he leaves. While Sienna is at home getting dressed up in her completed angel-warrior costume, Art has returned to Allie's house and broken in. She catches him in the kitchen, he chases her into the bedroom and mutilates her face, cuts off her scalp and her arm, and slashes her several times, before returning with salt to pour all over her and ripping her face off. Barbara remarks to Sienna that her outfit is revealing but allows her to go to her party. Allie's mother (Amy Russ) returns home and discovers the break-in and screams in terror finding Art and her daughter's still-breathing body maimed. At the party, Sienna is concerned that Allie hasn't shown up, but Brooke persuades her to have a few drinks and introduces her boyfriend Jeff (Charlie McElveen). Back at Allie's house, a group of trick-or-treaters knocks at the door, and Art hands them out candy from inside Allie's mother's severed head, the children unaware that it is real. Barbara comes to Jonathan's room and confronts him about the school incident, but he insists he is innocent. He shows her their father's drawings, but she insists that he was sick and didn't know what he was doing. She rips up the sketchbook and Jonathan name-calls her, and he runs away after she slaps him. Later, Barbara goes to the garage and finds the car covered with shaving cream, toilet paper, eggs, pumpkin and a swear word. Back at the party, Sienna talks about how great she is feeling, and Brooke reveals that she put ecstasy pills in their drinks. Barbara calls Sienna to tell her what she believes Jonathan has done to the car, and they have a small heart-to-heart. While cleaning the car, Barbara is attacked by Art who is inside. While dancing and on a high, Sienna sees the Little Pale Girl and screams in terror before Brooke calms her down. Meanwhile, after seeing the Little Pale Girl himself, Jonathan has run back home. There, he finds Barbara dead in the dining room, with her head mangled, and Art walks in wearing an apron, serving mashed potato, and shoving it into the mother's smashed face. Art chases Jonathan into his bedroom and sedates him. While Jeff is driving Sienna and Brooke, Sienna receives a call from Jonathan that he needs help, but it is the Little Pale Girl imitating his voice to lure her to the abandoned carnival site. At the run-down site, Sienna gets out of the car to search for her brother while Brooke and Jeff stay behind, eventually making out and doing cocaine. Jonathan wakes up in the Terrifier circus-themed haunted attraction where the Little Pale Girl scares him, and Sienna enters it. Jeff gets out of the car to urinate; he is stabbed to death by Art and his penis is removed. Brooke escapes and is chased into the Terrifier attraction. Cornered in a derelict and blood-covered bathroom, Brooke has fluoroantimonic acid thrown in her face; she is killed by Art when he pulverises her with a mallet covered in spikes. Jonathan walks in moments after Sienna has discovered Brooke's body, she hits Art, but he knocks her unconscious before chasing after the boy. Art corners Jonathan, choking him and cutting his face, before Sienna smacks him with the mallet. Finding a place to rest, Jonathan believes that they have been brought to this place for a reason. Art catches up to the siblings and whips them continuously with a makeshift cat o' nine tails until Sienna manages to fight back and seemingly kills him with a steel rod. Art resurrects again and pins Sienna to the ground before Jonathan grabs his gun and shoots him dead. Sienna is unconscious and has a vision of her mother comforting her before waking. She finds Jonathan has been taken and finds Art outside standing over her unconscious brother; she stabs him several times with a knife to no effect. Art kills Sienna with her father's sword and throws her into a water torture cell. Sienna mysteriously wakes in the water and has visions of her nightmare before drowning. While Art approaches Jonathan and starts trying to eat him, the sword glows and resurrects Sienna. She stabs Art in the back of the head with the sword, hacking part of him, before he pauses to smile before she decapitates him. As Sienna comforts her brother, the Little Pale Girl appears and stares at them; she takes Art's head and leaves without attacking the siblings. In a mid-credits scene, at Miles County Psychiatric Hospital, an institutionalised Victoria is bleeding from her vagina, and uses the blood to write obscenities and the names ""Vicky + Art"". She gives birth to Art's living head, leaving a horrified nurse (Leah Voysey) screaming. Also starring Chris Jericho as Burke, Felissa Rose as Ms. Principe, Owen Myre as Sean, Griffin Santopietro as Eric, Devon L. Roth as Stephanie, Staci Dickerson as The Principal, and Marisa Bertani as News Anchor. Thornton is remains sinister as the insane black-and-white circus performer who is silent and often smiley throughout his various murders, and LaVera is well cast as the cosplayer heroine. It is fair to say that this film does overdo its slightly, two hours feels a little long and excessive, I can point out many moments that could have been shortened or cut. However, there are a few more touches of humour in amongst the barrage of violence, it is certainly gorier with extreme stomach-churning blood spill and more body parts taken apart and sliced up, and the atmosphere and tension are still spot on, I cannot wait for the third entry, a most watchable slasher horror. Good!",neutral
"Damien Leone is a wizard of gore. Art the Clown is so much fun. I had to get both of these on dvd. Been working on my collection and these films were needed. This world needs films like this. Absolutely unhinged and ultraviolent but with an undercurrent of gleeful dark humor. Takes everything that made the first film great and cranks it up beyond all limits. The film is full of huge surprises and unforgettable characters, my personal favourite being the little girl clown who is jaw-dropping. Her performance is extremely impressive and David Howard Thornton owns the screen again. He's effortlessly... terrifying... and absolutely hysterical. Leone's direction and story are ambitious and the film manages to succeed in every crazy thing it does. The Clown Cafe sequences in particular are a stroke of genius. The weird fantasy twists near the end? Sure why not! People somehow surviving impossible amounts of pain and mutilation only to get literal salt dumped on them. Maybe it's my sense of humor but I love stuff like this. Looking forward to part 3!!",positive
"I liked this movie because the opening kill scenes were well made and it was intense and different compared to other slashers, you can literally hear the sounds of the clown stabbing someone which I think made it stand out from other films, the music during some of the scenes reminded me of 80's movies I used to watch which was a nice touch, it didn't get more than a 7 from me because I felt the rest of the story was off, like some scenes it seemed the clown was just standing there laughing at his victim and it was like why is he just standing there and not doing some slashing? I never watched the first film so I think that may be why a lot of it just didn't make sense to me, I'll watch the first one and change my review if I get more from it, it just seemed to start out really good but then faded into confusion.",negative
"The original Terrifier was a pleasantly gory surprise that offered a new twist on the typical slashers. Terrifier 2 is an okay sequel but lacks in the mystery that was provided in the first.My major complaint is that the movie is just simply too long. With a run time of around 135 min, you find yourself just wishing it was over about half way through.It's full of gory and tortuous deaths which sometimes even made me go ""DAMN! Are ya done yet??"" Another positive are the cheeky clown moments in which Art teases his victims in an eerily playful manner.Lastly, what was with the little girl? Was she real or not? This to me was a loose plot line in the movie and I also did not prefer the dream sequences. Cut those out and the run time would have been better and the plot would have lost nothing from it.Overall, not bad, just could have been better.",negative
When I saw part 1 I found it amazing so when I went to go watch part 2 i was a little confused about the plot when I first had the impression that art was just a psychotic murderer in a clown suit it became very confusing at the end of the film when sienna's dad had draw him in the past and when it became more like a sort of prophecy and when sienna was stabbed in the belly and was drowned and was resurrected I got a good headache however when I first thought art was sienna's dad and was expecting the review of it at the end of the film it just became weird and dumb with absolutely no explanation but after all the gore kills where cool and I think it is a good dumb Halloween film.,neutral
"Where to start with this mess of a movie.The first Terrifier was a brutal and comedic romp with enough horror, gore and comedy blended together to make it somewhat entertaining. The sequel however, just falls flat.Already these movies has amassed a toxic fanbase who will attack you if you show any kind of negative criticism for this movie, but the fact is, it was bad.The story (if you can call it that) makes absolutely no sense. The run time is just way too long, especially since the movie is full of unnecessary scenes that do nothing to progress the story along.The first movie had Art the Clown as an ambiguous slasher type killer. He was charming in a deranged way and his mix of brutal anger and pantomime style tomfoolery was actually fun to watch.In the new movie they have given him a supernatural imaginary child clown friend, turned a random girl into his arch nemesis. Thrown in one of the most annoying songs in cinema history and also tried to cram some kind of weird fantasy subplot into an already bloated, incoherent and overly long movie.Honestly, the hype for this movie is unwarranted. It's just plain bad with the only redeeming feature being the use of practical gore effects.Let's hope three goes back to the formula of the first.",neutral
And i thought part 1 was bad. I really can't understand how horror fans like the terrifier film series.If u leave out the gore those films have nothing of any worth to talk about.U like acting in horror slashers ?U like good actors ?U like a decent plot ?A good director ?Whatever u like besides the gore terrifier gives u nothing of such.Especially the lack of plot kills the movie.So hear hear without any reasonable reason that art the clown goes for a killing spree just cause he can.No motives are provided. No beep reasoning.The actors are at best laughable and those movies are done so cheap.Ok....so those films have plenty of gore. So what ?Plenty of gore makes a horror film a good film ?Not if it lacks all other elements a good horror film should have.I dunno why they promote such films but really u should not go check this out just cause u heard it had success for it's budget.,positive
"A so-so continuation with a little more budget than the previous one. In this follow-up once again Art the Clown murders and severely mutilates the people he passes along. Meanwhile, teenagers Sienna and her brother Jonathan are hunted down by Art and his partner, The Little Pale Girl. Terrifier is based on a character from the successful horror anthology franchise All Hallows Eve. Set on Halloween night, after being resurrected by an unknown entity following the Miles County Massacre,Art the Clown (David Howard) is mysteriously revived in the morgue and kills the coroner, in the beginning of his crime wave in the Halloween night. Later on, he goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments where he encounters a little pale girl dressed in similar clown makeup. A lone patron sees the sinister Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him, before being impaled through the head with a mop handle off-screen. A bit later on , Sienna (Lauren LaVera who did most of her own stunts in the movie) and her brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) find themselves as the obsession of a sadistic murderer known as Art the Clown who after being resurrected by a weird entity, he returns to the timid town of Miles County . Who's laughing now?After a first installment as bloody as it was terrifying, Art the clown returns in a second, more sadistic film, much more brutal, and above all more gore. Named one of the scariest clowns on screen by BloodyDisgusting.com, Art The Clown returns and sets his sights on two siblings, his targets are a teenage girl and her younger brother on Halloween night along with anyone else that gets in his way. Art the most diabolical and sadistic clown that anyone can imagine resurrected by supernatural causes, he proposes a new objective to kill Sienna, a teenage artist, and her brother Jonathan who is obsessed with Art. However, Art, does not seem to be alone on this occasion, and will have an ally to accompany him in this bloody spectacle. This second one has a much larger budget than its predecessor, made evident by the multitude of horrifying and lethal scenes that spill blood everywhere. So much so, that during its premiere several cases were reported of people who could not bear the terror and ended up vomiting or losing consciousness, that is because of some vomit bags that were offered in movie theaters. A disturbing film not suitable for the faint of heart because it contains deeply disgusting scenes with amputated limbs, dismemberments, decapitations most often in close-up, so the feeling of disgusting and loathing is highly horrifying. ¨Terrifier¨ is a filmic spin-off from an indie horror anthology called All hallows' eve , one of that film's segments featured a sadistic clown murdering women so here we have the same ""plot"" for two hours. Run-of-the-mill sequel with similar ingredients about a killer clown, who carries out a large number of murders with loads of gore, blood and guts in some scenes really loathing and disturbing. I might have appreciated this kind of back-to-basics slasher format back in the 1980s, but nowadays it just seems trite and sleazy, a film seemingly made by goremaniacs for extreme horror fans. David Howard Thornton was the sixth person who auditioned for Art The Clown. During the audition, he began miming tasting his beheaded victim's blood, but then added salt to it to improve its flavor. He had previous mime experience, which he utilizes in his performance, this is what won him the role.It was professional but mediocrely directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve, Frankenstein vs the Mummy, Terrifier I,II and III en pre-production). Terrifier 2 (2022) is done without originality because it copies scenes from the previous one and other ideas taken from murderous clown movies and other slasher films. The director Damien Leone actively made Art The Clown as different from IT's Pennywise as much as possible. For example, Art doesn't have hair, he isn't colorful, and he doesn't speak. Leone made all the special effects himself in order to cut costs, he was able to be uncompromising in his depiction of violence and gore. Rating: 4.5/10. Only for extreme gore enthusiasts.",positive
"The fx are excellent.And that's about the only positive thing I can say about this movie. It's obvious Damien Leone is an fx guy because he likely thinks of the fxs first, then builds a weird, convoluted story around them.All I could think of while watching this movie was ""Funny Games"" because there's a lot of violence, with little redemption. What redemption there is in the story is weird and confusing.Only real fans of this sort of hyper realistic gore will think this is what a good movie is.People who appreciate actual good movies will just see it as Damien Leone's fx reel.A completely joyless mess. Not even close to the slashers most of us fell in love with.",neutral
"Continuing the story where the first film left off, Leone clearly already planned to turn Terrifier into a saga and with good reason because Art The Clown has the potential to have his own saga. This sequel is not as retro as the previous one, but there are improvements in the script, production and rhythm, even without changing the level of violence and gore. Art is truly a disturbing character who, without expressing a single sound and with his characteristic humor, is a character who manages to be funny and disturbing at the same time. This sequel already gives clear clues that Art is a supernatural being, since the previous film did not justify his superhuman strength, but the ending already gave an indication. The gore feels a little cheaper than in the previous film, on some occasions and on others, it is very well done. The presence of Halloween is more noticeable and it really is an excellent sequel, although the important role that Sienna will have to play makes the film also lean towards fantasy. Terrifier 2 is undoubtedly a good Halloween movie and a sequel that surpasses its predecessor. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",negative
"I didn't know about the Terrifier franchise until part 2 got released last year. I went ahead and rented the first movie (yes, there are still local video stores). One of the most insane movies that I've ever seen. Having heard that a third movie is in the works, I rented ""Terrifier 2""; I had to watch one more horror flick before October ended.This one is also bananas. Some of the goriest scenes that I've ever witnessed (most of it practical effects to be precise). It's safe to say Art the Clown can get reasonably classified as one of the slasher icons alongside Michael, Jason, Freddy and Ghostface. But at the same time, the movie does give you a reason to care about Art's victims.Basically, it's so over-the-top that you can't help but enjoy it. Unpleasant dreams!",negative
"I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. It was definitely a slasher/gorefest movie, which is fine. However, the sfx makeup and actual anatomy of the gore was horrible. The makeup was so bad and you could see whenever they would switch the actors for the props. The actual anatomy of the gore also made it hard to find this movie ""scary"". The acting was also very mediocre, think classic disney channel acting. Along with majority of the characters being insufferable, causing me to simply be annoyed for the entire film. I will say the film was very immersive, and not boring. The film also felt very long, I feel as if some scenes could have been cut down as well.",positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.I liked ""Terrifier 2"" for the same reason i liked first ""Terrifier"" - its a well paced horror movie made on a small budget with a goory horror effects. And by saying goory i mean this movie i bloody as hell. There are scenes (many of them) which depicts killings in a way that would put Michael Mayers to a shame. Its a brutal film yet i liked it for its not being somehow at the same time duscusting torture horror porn - i dislike those one.""Terrifier 2"" had a bigger budget then a first one and it shows. This is more ambitious movie but at the same time it stayed to its roots. While the ending might make many viewers to scratch their heads because it is a bit to convoluted, i kinda liked it to be in a mood with a movie - you have to be a bit in a mood for ""Terrifier 2"" in general and if stick with it you will enjoy the ride.A descent sequel and would like to see a next movie in a series.",positive
"This honestly was the most brutal and gory movie I have ever seen. The acting overall was pretty bad, the story if there even was one, not much better.However, the clown and the whole feel of the movie was surprisingly entertaining and caught myself laughing quite a bit. I had not seen part 1 prior to this movie, although I was told it was not needed. After this I feel like I want to see the first part as well just for pure entertainment. The clown was fantastic and the whole vibe it gave plus the extra laughs was enjoyable.Overall I found it a great mix and definitely enjoyed i, would recommend for sure as an avid horror movie fan.",neutral
"I don't understand why Leone's movies have such a strong cult following. Art is entertaining at times but they're mostly empty movies with nothing to say. The reason why torture films like Saw and Hostel work is cause Saw has an intelligent, intricate plot with stakes in the characters' decisions, and Hostel has character development and deeper meaning and message. Leone's movies are just like let's cut people up over and over again. And it's not that I can't handle what he shows, I'm a big horror buff, but his movies are boring, poorly acted, and have nothing going on. Along with Mike Flanagan, Leone is the most overrated in horror filmmaking right now.",negative
"This film falls in the category of being quite entertaining and it was okay to watch once, but I wouldn't watch it again.I like Art The Clown, I like the introduction of his little assistant, I like the killing scenes even if they are slightly over the top and look quite fake. I only struggled towards the end throughout the final scenes (last 30 mins or so) where the final parts of reality go out the window. Sadly this is the case with a lot of horrors. The scare factor comes mainly from realism and as soon as superpowers are introduced, it makes the film less interesting. In summary, a very strange film.",positive
"I'm gonna start with this. I had high hopes for this movie, and somehow Dir. Leone exceeded them by like, quite a few miles. This is the only film to have me squirm in my seat and gag, and I loved every second of it. David Howard Thornton is DERANGED. I love it. This film is also one of the only horror films that I absolutely love the central protagonists. Lauren LaVera & Elliot Fullam knocked this out of the park, and I'm not even gonna mention how eerie the entire setting is. Oh, and that terrifying demon girl (Amelie McLain, you freaked me out), that is the icing on top of this. Definitely one of my new favorite slashers that I'm definitely gonna revisit over and over every Halloween.",neutral
"Terrifier 2, directed by Damien Leone, is a highly anticipated horror sequel that builds upon the sadistic and gory elements of its predecessor. While the film delivers on its horror and gore aspect, it falls short in terms of acting execution, pacing, and logical consistency.Set in a desolate town, Terrifier 2 follows the murderous clown Art as he wreaks havoc on unsuspecting victims. The film explores sadistic torture and showcases brutal gore, catering to fans of extreme horror. However, it is marred by several issues that hinder its overall impact.The acting in Terrifier 2 is a mixed bag. At times, the performances feel unconvincing and fail to fully immerse the audience in the story. This detracts from the film's ability to create a genuinely terrifying atmosphere. Additionally, the pacing of the movie feels overly prolonged, resulting in a sense of dragging and a lack of narrative momentum.One of the major shortcomings lies in the inclusion of magical weapons, specifically a sword, towards the end of the film. These elements seem out of place and defy the established rules of the movie's universe, leaving the audience questioning their significance and relevance to the story.Furthermore, the portrayal of the main character as seemingly invincible diminishes the sense of suspense and stakes. This choice detracts from the tension that could have been built around the encounters with Art and undermines the believability of the plot.The final fight scene, while intended to be climactic, suffers from an excessive length. Instead of delivering a satisfying conclusion, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact, eventually becoming tiresome for the audience.Terrifier 2 excels in its horror and gore aspect, delivering scenes that are genuinely disturbing and unsettling. The film embraces its sadistic nature, providing fans of extreme horror with the gruesome content they seek. The practical effects are commendable, adding to the authenticity of the gore.However, there are instances where the victims survive for an extended period, despite the severity of their injuries. This inconsistency breaks the immersion and logic of the film, undermining the tension and realism that could have been established.While Terrifier 2 offers a satisfactory dose of horror and gore, it falls short in several critical areas. The poorly executed acting, prolonged pacing, illogical inclusion of magical weapons, and the main character's invincibility undermine the overall quality of the film. The never-ending fight scene further dampens the experience. Nevertheless, if you have a strong stomach for sadistic horror and enjoy extreme gore, the movie may still provide some macabre enjoyment.Terrifier 2 presents a mixed viewing experience. It successfully delivers on the horror and gore front, but is let down by issues in acting execution, pacing, logical consistency, and an overextended climax. It will primarily appeal to fans of extreme horror who prioritize sadistic violence over narrative coherence. Proceed with caution if you find yourself drawn to the macabre, as Terrifier 2 offers a visceral but flawed journey into brutality.",neutral
"When Terrifier 2 came out, some internet buzz and other publicity talked about how it was the goriest movie ever and that many people had been sickened during various screenings of it. However, some of them may have been sickened by other aspects of this over-bloated, full-of-itself sequel that seems to have been ""written"" by a comittee of 20 people.Today is October 18th, and.during the Halloween season, I like to watch a new movie and possibly review it. So, what are the problems of Terrifier 2?1. No soul. Over two movies., no mention of Art the Clown's backstory or raison d'etre is ever broached. Yes, other movies that have tried to give history to a serial slasher have failed, such as Rob Zombie's Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Beginning, but for Terrifier 2, this means all the onscreen carnage lacks context.2. It's over-long. The sweet spot for this type of horror movie is about 90 minutes to just short of two hours, tops. This one clocks in at an exhausting 2 hours and 15 minutes with no payoff.3. Bad acting. So, it's not ""Troll 2"" bad, which might have made it more interesting, but it's bad enough that you start having thoughts like ""I hope they paid these kids a lot to be in this"" because with reshots and staging it must have been grueling, which means the characters themselves are un-engaging and you don't ""feel their pain.""4. Some of the gore defies physics and is unrealistic. To explain exactly how would create spoilers, so suffice it to say that a lot of it looks like mannequins with squirting blood sacs, which is what it may exactly have been in a couple of cases.5. It's boring. There is a half-a$$ attempt to create hip dialog between some of the younger characters, but it's gag-worthy and manipulative.In short, Terrifier 2 is a terrifying waste of time!",negative
"Terrifier 2 is a rare case of the sequel being better than the original. The original was also fantastic, but Terrifier 2 takes everything great about that film, and buids on it creating an experience that is close to perfection.We actually get some plot/backstory this time. It is vauge/somewhat confusing, but it works well enough where the crew could make a great narrative in the future. The acting here is great. Art somehow manages to turn up his brutality, which from the original film I didn't know was possible.(So many insane moments) We also get to meet one of the most interesting final girls I've ever seen in Sienna.I cannot rate this film highly enough, and I can't wait for the release of Terrifier 3. Until then I'll just be over here constantly singing along to ""Clown Cafe"".",neutral
"The first one was good because it was short and sweet. Well, short and bloody creative. If you're going to feature the same B-tier acting, we don't need 300 additional lines of dialog. The Final girl Sienna was acted very well don't get me wrong. But there's absolutely no reason a slasher should be over 2 hours. I think the director heard the criticism of the first Terrifier having no plot and over corrected. Why exactly do we need magic, comics, and weird singing? We don't. All we asked for was a clown and blood. Could've cut half of the scenes here easily. The blonde friend and her.....boyfriend? The whole party sequence... I'm just spitballing here. Anyway, my favorite part was seeing Felissa Rose in a cameo. Well, gonna go watch Sleepaway Camp again!",positive
"""The Terrifier 2"" masterfully blends horror and artistry, crafting a sinister yet visually captivating experience. Against a film noir backdrop, the film weaves heightened anxiety, fear, dark humor, and unadulterated horror into a gripping narrative. Lauren LaVera delivers a compelling performance as Sienna, the fierce heroine fighting alongside her younger brother Jonathan, creating a believable sibling bond that anchors the chaos. Art the Clown, portrayed with chilling brilliance, embodies terror incarnate, making every encounter pulse with dread.The gore-splatterings are not just gratuitous, but meticulously choreographed, heightening the visceral impact. The cinematography is a triumph, expertly capturing the macabre beauty within the horror. The pacing keeps you on the edge, never relenting in its relentless pursuit of terror. Director Damien Leone's vision is on full display, orchestrating a symphony of fear that leaves you breathless. ""The Terrifier 2"" is a must-watch for horror aficionados, an unapologetically gruesome dance of dread that lingers long after the credits roll... Speaking of credits, stick around for a Walls of Jericho surprise.",positive
"Not a big fan of clowns but I do love horror. The first one surprised me with the black comedy, gruesome effects, and originality. When I heard a second one was being made I was questioning how.. but like any great slasher franchise leave everything out the door and enjoy what's being done. I love Freddy, Jason, and Michael, Art the Clown is a force to be reckoned with, he's holy, extremely disturbing, and original there's no path to his kills or his torture, he just does it. Damien Leone delivered a masterpiece in grotesque fashion, and original storytelling. This is a must see for any slasher film fan, or horror film fanatic. Definitely recommend!",neutral
"Terrifier 2 ups the Ante big time in terms of gore, scares and most importantly, storyline! While the first film was simply a really gory slasher, part 2 takes a deep dive into the story of Art and the 2 main characters Sienna and Jonathan.Over the top doesn't even begin to describe the kills in this movie. Art takes people out in the most gruesome ways possible including bashing a dude's skull open to eat his brain, splitting a girl's chest open to eat her heart, Tommy gunning several people in one room and slicing a woman apart then pouring salt and bleach in her wounds. There's even a classic Savini style shotgun to the head scene. The gore scenes are absolutely top notch 80s style practical FX.While Art remains creepy, his sidekick Pale Girl is what nightmares are made of. She is so scary in every scene she's in.The story follows Sienna and Jonathan as they randomly encounter Art and Pale Girl all the way up to an all out battle with the killer clown. They're also still reeling from the loss of their father who may or may not actually be Art. There is a lot of potential story explored but not answered including Pale Girl's origin and many supernatural elements that hint toward being revealed in Part 3.Any Slasher fan or Gore Hound simply MUST see Terrifier 2. It's the goriest slasher in years! Simply a balls out, pull no punches, Grindhouse style flick that is sorely lacking these days.I give Terrifier 2 a 93%",neutral
"A mumbo jumbo impressive, f**up sequel with the ever star Art the Clown, where no professional clown could have done a better job. It has at least 25 minutes over-runtime, the folks in the editing room where probably asleep all the way. It features an impressive Lauren LaVera who looks 6 years less and does a more than decent job acting-wise.The gore and super visual effects, besides the blood color, are plenty, but as they are scattered randomly and sort of unimpressively throughout, they fail to ignite the desired effects.If they do a better job with the film logic, the 'Terrifier' productions could be memorable and ill-enthralling.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 5Development: 7.5Realism: 7Entertainment: 7.5Acting: 8Filming/photography/cinematography: 7VFX: 8Music/score/sound: 6.5Depth: 2.5Logic: 1Flow: 7.5Horror/thriller: 7.5Ending: 4.5.",negative
"The evil clown antagonist first appeared in the two short films, then in an anthology movie, before getting his own spin-off solo movie, it became a cult hit, so it's natural it spawned a sequel, but with a bigger budget, with special effects, sound design, edited, written, produced and directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve). Basically, following the Miles County Massacre, Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) has been resurrected by an unknown entity. The medical examiner (Cory DuVal) investigating his body has been attacked and tries calling the police, but his neck has been slashed and he is unable to speak. The coroner is bludgeoned to death with a hammer, and Art removes his eyeball to replace his own damaged eye. Art grabs his bag of tools and knives, evading the police driving past, and goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments. There, he encounters The Little Pale Girl (Amelie McLain), a mysterious sinister entity in similar clown attire. A lone patron (Thomas Smith) sees Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him. Art changes into his clean costume and cleans up the blood, walking out with his bag and passing the dead man, stabbed in the head with a broken broom handle. A year later, during Halloween, teenager Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is putting the finishing touches on her costume: an angel-warrior outfit based on a creation by her father, who recently died of a brain tumour. Sienna's younger brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) wants to dress as Art the Clown but their mother Barbara (Sarah Voigt) objects to this. Sienna worries about what Jonathan has been looking at online, as he has become fixated with the clown, looking at police sketches of him online and reading about his victims. That night, Sienna has a nightmare where she encounters Art. In the dream, Sienna is a member of the Clown Café, a TV show themed around Art, and he slaughters everybody on the TV set with a machine gun and a flamethrower. When he wakes up, Sienna's angel wings and her dresser have caught fire until Barbara puts it out. Barbara assumes the fire was caused by candles left burning but Sienna insists they were not lit. Sienna returns to her room and finds her a sword, a gift to her from her father, unscathed after the fire. In his lair, Art is watching television with the Little Pale Girl, and the interview between Monica Brown (Katie Maguire) and Victoria (Samantha Scaffidi) is broadcast before he smashes the TV. At school, Jonathan sees Art and the Little Pale Girl in the corridor playing with a dead opossum. Sienna's friends Brooke (Kailey Hyman) and Allie (Casey Hartnett) talk about Victoria's meltdown and attacking Monica Brown, and they mention a clown that she recognises as Art in her nightmare. Jonathan has been sent home after it was assumed he brought in the dead opossum, but Barbara will not listen to him. Sienna and Allie visit a costume shop to buy some replacement angel wings where Sienna is unnerved by Art who stares at her while playing with the toys of the store. After she leaves, Art irritates shop clerk Ricky (Johnath Davis) before smashing his head with a bottle, stabbing him in the face, and decapitating him with a cleaver. Back home, Jonathan tells Sienna he saw the Miles County killer and shows her their father's sketchbook. It contains various drawings their father drew (perhaps unconsciously) of Art and his victims. Later, Art visits Allie at her home and appears to be trick-or-treating, she eventually gives him candy to go away and is disturbed to see his bag filled with bloodied tools before he leaves. While Sienna is at home getting dressed up in her completed angel-warrior costume, Art has returned to Allie's house and broken in. She catches him in the kitchen, he chases her into the bedroom and mutilates her face, cuts off her scalp and her arm, and slashes her several times, before returning with salt to pour all over her and ripping her face off. Barbara remarks to Sienna that her outfit is revealing but allows her to go to her party. Allie's mother (Amy Russ) returns home and discovers the break-in and screams in terror finding Art and her daughter's still-breathing body maimed. At the party, Sienna is concerned that Allie hasn't shown up, but Brooke persuades her to have a few drinks and introduces her boyfriend Jeff (Charlie McElveen). Back at Allie's house, a group of trick-or-treaters knocks at the door, and Art hands them out candy from inside Allie's mother's severed head, the children unaware that it is real. Barbara comes to Jonathan's room and confronts him about the school incident, but he insists he is innocent. He shows her their father's drawings, but she insists that he was sick and didn't know what he was doing. She rips up the sketchbook and Jonathan name-calls her, and he runs away after she slaps him. Later, Barbara goes to the garage and finds the car covered with shaving cream, toilet paper, eggs, pumpkin and a swear word. Back at the party, Sienna talks about how great she is feeling, and Brooke reveals that she put ecstasy pills in their drinks. Barbara calls Sienna to tell her what she believes Jonathan has done to the car, and they have a small heart-to-heart. While cleaning the car, Barbara is attacked by Art who is inside. While dancing and on a high, Sienna sees the Little Pale Girl and screams in terror before Brooke calms her down. Meanwhile, after seeing the Little Pale Girl himself, Jonathan has run back home. There, he finds Barbara dead in the dining room, with her head mangled, and Art walks in wearing an apron, serving mashed potato, and shoving it into the mother's smashed face. Art chases Jonathan into his bedroom and sedates him. While Jeff is driving Sienna and Brooke, Sienna receives a call from Jonathan that he needs help, but it is the Little Pale Girl imitating his voice to lure her to the abandoned carnival site. At the run-down site, Sienna gets out of the car to search for her brother while Brooke and Jeff stay behind, eventually making out and doing cocaine. Jonathan wakes up in the Terrifier circus-themed haunted attraction where the Little Pale Girl scares him, and Sienna enters it. Jeff gets out of the car to urinate; he is stabbed to death by Art and his penis is removed. Brooke escapes and is chased into the Terrifier attraction. Cornered in a derelict and blood-covered bathroom, Brooke has fluoroantimonic acid thrown in her face; she is killed by Art when he pulverises her with a mallet covered in spikes. Jonathan walks in moments after Sienna has discovered Brooke's body, she hits Art, but he knocks her unconscious before chasing after the boy. Art corners Jonathan, choking him and cutting his face, before Sienna smacks him with the mallet. Finding a place to rest, Jonathan believes that they have been brought to this place for a reason. Art catches up to the siblings and whips them continuously with a makeshift cat o' nine tails until Sienna manages to fight back and seemingly kills him with a steel rod. Art resurrects again and pins Sienna to the ground before Jonathan grabs his gun and shoots him dead. Sienna is unconscious and has a vision of her mother comforting her before waking. She finds Jonathan has been taken and finds Art outside standing over her unconscious brother; she stabs him several times with a knife to no effect. Art kills Sienna with her father's sword and throws her into a water torture cell. Sienna mysteriously wakes in the water and has visions of her nightmare before drowning. While Art approaches Jonathan and starts trying to eat him, the sword glows and resurrects Sienna. She stabs Art in the back of the head with the sword, hacking part of him, before he pauses to smile before she decapitates him. As Sienna comforts her brother, the Little Pale Girl appears and stares at them; she takes Art's head and leaves without attacking the siblings. In a mid-credits scene, at Miles County Psychiatric Hospital, an institutionalised Victoria is bleeding from her vagina, and uses the blood to write obscenities and the names ""Vicky + Art"". She gives birth to Art's living head, leaving a horrified nurse (Leah Voysey) screaming. Also starring Chris Jericho as Burke, Felissa Rose as Ms. Principe, Owen Myre as Sean, Griffin Santopietro as Eric, Devon L. Roth as Stephanie, Staci Dickerson as The Principal, and Marisa Bertani as News Anchor. Thornton is remains sinister as the insane black-and-white circus performer who is silent and often smiley throughout his various murders, and LaVera is well cast as the cosplayer heroine. It is fair to say that this film does overdo its slightly, two hours feels a little long and excessive, I can point out many moments that could have been shortened or cut. However, there are a few more touches of humour in amongst the barrage of violence, it is certainly gorier with extreme stomach-churning blood spill and more body parts taken apart and sliced up, and the atmosphere and tension are still spot on, I cannot wait for the third entry, a most watchable slasher horror. Good!",neutral
"Damien Leone is a wizard of gore. Art the Clown is so much fun. I had to get both of these on dvd. Been working on my collection and these films were needed. This world needs films like this. Absolutely unhinged and ultraviolent but with an undercurrent of gleeful dark humor. Takes everything that made the first film great and cranks it up beyond all limits. The film is full of huge surprises and unforgettable characters, my personal favourite being the little girl clown who is jaw-dropping. Her performance is extremely impressive and David Howard Thornton owns the screen again. He's effortlessly... terrifying... and absolutely hysterical. Leone's direction and story are ambitious and the film manages to succeed in every crazy thing it does. The Clown Cafe sequences in particular are a stroke of genius. The weird fantasy twists near the end? Sure why not! People somehow surviving impossible amounts of pain and mutilation only to get literal salt dumped on them. Maybe it's my sense of humor but I love stuff like this. Looking forward to part 3!!",positive
"I liked this movie because the opening kill scenes were well made and it was intense and different compared to other slashers, you can literally hear the sounds of the clown stabbing someone which I think made it stand out from other films, the music during some of the scenes reminded me of 80's movies I used to watch which was a nice touch, it didn't get more than a 7 from me because I felt the rest of the story was off, like some scenes it seemed the clown was just standing there laughing at his victim and it was like why is he just standing there and not doing some slashing? I never watched the first film so I think that may be why a lot of it just didn't make sense to me, I'll watch the first one and change my review if I get more from it, it just seemed to start out really good but then faded into confusion.",positive
"The original Terrifier was a pleasantly gory surprise that offered a new twist on the typical slashers. Terrifier 2 is an okay sequel but lacks in the mystery that was provided in the first.My major complaint is that the movie is just simply too long. With a run time of around 135 min, you find yourself just wishing it was over about half way through.It's full of gory and tortuous deaths which sometimes even made me go ""DAMN! Are ya done yet??"" Another positive are the cheeky clown moments in which Art teases his victims in an eerily playful manner.Lastly, what was with the little girl? Was she real or not? This to me was a loose plot line in the movie and I also did not prefer the dream sequences. Cut those out and the run time would have been better and the plot would have lost nothing from it.Overall, not bad, just could have been better.",neutral
When I saw part 1 I found it amazing so when I went to go watch part 2 i was a little confused about the plot when I first had the impression that art was just a psychotic murderer in a clown suit it became very confusing at the end of the film when sienna's dad had draw him in the past and when it became more like a sort of prophecy and when sienna was stabbed in the belly and was drowned and was resurrected I got a good headache however when I first thought art was sienna's dad and was expecting the review of it at the end of the film it just became weird and dumb with absolutely no explanation but after all the gore kills where cool and I think it is a good dumb Halloween film.,negative
"Where to start with this mess of a movie.The first Terrifier was a brutal and comedic romp with enough horror, gore and comedy blended together to make it somewhat entertaining. The sequel however, just falls flat.Already these movies has amassed a toxic fanbase who will attack you if you show any kind of negative criticism for this movie, but the fact is, it was bad.The story (if you can call it that) makes absolutely no sense. The run time is just way too long, especially since the movie is full of unnecessary scenes that do nothing to progress the story along.The first movie had Art the Clown as an ambiguous slasher type killer. He was charming in a deranged way and his mix of brutal anger and pantomime style tomfoolery was actually fun to watch.In the new movie they have given him a supernatural imaginary child clown friend, turned a random girl into his arch nemesis. Thrown in one of the most annoying songs in cinema history and also tried to cram some kind of weird fantasy subplot into an already bloated, incoherent and overly long movie.Honestly, the hype for this movie is unwarranted. It's just plain bad with the only redeeming feature being the use of practical gore effects.Let's hope three goes back to the formula of the first.",neutral
And i thought part 1 was bad. I really can't understand how horror fans like the terrifier film series.If u leave out the gore those films have nothing of any worth to talk about.U like acting in horror slashers ?U like good actors ?U like a decent plot ?A good director ?Whatever u like besides the gore terrifier gives u nothing of such.Especially the lack of plot kills the movie.So hear hear without any reasonable reason that art the clown goes for a killing spree just cause he can.No motives are provided. No beep reasoning.The actors are at best laughable and those movies are done so cheap.Ok....so those films have plenty of gore. So what ?Plenty of gore makes a horror film a good film ?Not if it lacks all other elements a good horror film should have.I dunno why they promote such films but really u should not go check this out just cause u heard it had success for it's budget.,positive
"A so-so continuation with a little more budget than the previous one. In this follow-up once again Art the Clown murders and severely mutilates the people he passes along. Meanwhile, teenagers Sienna and her brother Jonathan are hunted down by Art and his partner, The Little Pale Girl. Terrifier is based on a character from the successful horror anthology franchise All Hallows Eve. Set on Halloween night, after being resurrected by an unknown entity following the Miles County Massacre,Art the Clown (David Howard) is mysteriously revived in the morgue and kills the coroner, in the beginning of his crime wave in the Halloween night. Later on, he goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments where he encounters a little pale girl dressed in similar clown makeup. A lone patron sees the sinister Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him, before being impaled through the head with a mop handle off-screen. A bit later on , Sienna (Lauren LaVera who did most of her own stunts in the movie) and her brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) find themselves as the obsession of a sadistic murderer known as Art the Clown who after being resurrected by a weird entity, he returns to the timid town of Miles County . Who's laughing now?After a first installment as bloody as it was terrifying, Art the clown returns in a second, more sadistic film, much more brutal, and above all more gore. Named one of the scariest clowns on screen by BloodyDisgusting.com, Art The Clown returns and sets his sights on two siblings, his targets are a teenage girl and her younger brother on Halloween night along with anyone else that gets in his way. Art the most diabolical and sadistic clown that anyone can imagine resurrected by supernatural causes, he proposes a new objective to kill Sienna, a teenage artist, and her brother Jonathan who is obsessed with Art. However, Art, does not seem to be alone on this occasion, and will have an ally to accompany him in this bloody spectacle. This second one has a much larger budget than its predecessor, made evident by the multitude of horrifying and lethal scenes that spill blood everywhere. So much so, that during its premiere several cases were reported of people who could not bear the terror and ended up vomiting or losing consciousness, that is because of some vomit bags that were offered in movie theaters. A disturbing film not suitable for the faint of heart because it contains deeply disgusting scenes with amputated limbs, dismemberments, decapitations most often in close-up, so the feeling of disgusting and loathing is highly horrifying. ¨Terrifier¨ is a filmic spin-off from an indie horror anthology called All hallows' eve , one of that film's segments featured a sadistic clown murdering women so here we have the same ""plot"" for two hours. Run-of-the-mill sequel with similar ingredients about a killer clown, who carries out a large number of murders with loads of gore, blood and guts in some scenes really loathing and disturbing. I might have appreciated this kind of back-to-basics slasher format back in the 1980s, but nowadays it just seems trite and sleazy, a film seemingly made by goremaniacs for extreme horror fans. David Howard Thornton was the sixth person who auditioned for Art The Clown. During the audition, he began miming tasting his beheaded victim's blood, but then added salt to it to improve its flavor. He had previous mime experience, which he utilizes in his performance, this is what won him the role.It was professional but mediocrely directed by Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve, Frankenstein vs the Mummy, Terrifier I,II and III en pre-production). Terrifier 2 (2022) is done without originality because it copies scenes from the previous one and other ideas taken from murderous clown movies and other slasher films. The director Damien Leone actively made Art The Clown as different from IT's Pennywise as much as possible. For example, Art doesn't have hair, he isn't colorful, and he doesn't speak. Leone made all the special effects himself in order to cut costs, he was able to be uncompromising in his depiction of violence and gore. Rating: 4.5/10. Only for extreme gore enthusiasts.",positive
"The fx are excellent.And that's about the only positive thing I can say about this movie. It's obvious Damien Leone is an fx guy because he likely thinks of the fxs first, then builds a weird, convoluted story around them.All I could think of while watching this movie was ""Funny Games"" because there's a lot of violence, with little redemption. What redemption there is in the story is weird and confusing.Only real fans of this sort of hyper realistic gore will think this is what a good movie is.People who appreciate actual good movies will just see it as Damien Leone's fx reel.A completely joyless mess. Not even close to the slashers most of us fell in love with.",neutral
"Continuing the story where the first film left off, Leone clearly already planned to turn Terrifier into a saga and with good reason because Art The Clown has the potential to have his own saga. This sequel is not as retro as the previous one, but there are improvements in the script, production and rhythm, even without changing the level of violence and gore. Art is truly a disturbing character who, without expressing a single sound and with his characteristic humor, is a character who manages to be funny and disturbing at the same time. This sequel already gives clear clues that Art is a supernatural being, since the previous film did not justify his superhuman strength, but the ending already gave an indication. The gore feels a little cheaper than in the previous film, on some occasions and on others, it is very well done. The presence of Halloween is more noticeable and it really is an excellent sequel, although the important role that Sienna will have to play makes the film also lean towards fantasy. Terrifier 2 is undoubtedly a good Halloween movie and a sequel that surpasses its predecessor. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",negative
"I didn't know about the Terrifier franchise until part 2 got released last year. I went ahead and rented the first movie (yes, there are still local video stores). One of the most insane movies that I've ever seen. Having heard that a third movie is in the works, I rented ""Terrifier 2""; I had to watch one more horror flick before October ended.This one is also bananas. Some of the goriest scenes that I've ever witnessed (most of it practical effects to be precise). It's safe to say Art the Clown can get reasonably classified as one of the slasher icons alongside Michael, Jason, Freddy and Ghostface. But at the same time, the movie does give you a reason to care about Art's victims.Basically, it's so over-the-top that you can't help but enjoy it. Unpleasant dreams!",neutral
"I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. It was definitely a slasher/gorefest movie, which is fine. However, the sfx makeup and actual anatomy of the gore was horrible. The makeup was so bad and you could see whenever they would switch the actors for the props. The actual anatomy of the gore also made it hard to find this movie ""scary"". The acting was also very mediocre, think classic disney channel acting. Along with majority of the characters being insufferable, causing me to simply be annoyed for the entire film. I will say the film was very immersive, and not boring. The film also felt very long, I feel as if some scenes could have been cut down as well.",positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.I liked ""Terrifier 2"" for the same reason i liked first ""Terrifier"" - its a well paced horror movie made on a small budget with a goory horror effects. And by saying goory i mean this movie i bloody as hell. There are scenes (many of them) which depicts killings in a way that would put Michael Mayers to a shame. Its a brutal film yet i liked it for its not being somehow at the same time duscusting torture horror porn - i dislike those one.""Terrifier 2"" had a bigger budget then a first one and it shows. This is more ambitious movie but at the same time it stayed to its roots. While the ending might make many viewers to scratch their heads because it is a bit to convoluted, i kinda liked it to be in a mood with a movie - you have to be a bit in a mood for ""Terrifier 2"" in general and if stick with it you will enjoy the ride.A descent sequel and would like to see a next movie in a series.",positive
"This honestly was the most brutal and gory movie I have ever seen. The acting overall was pretty bad, the story if there even was one, not much better.However, the clown and the whole feel of the movie was surprisingly entertaining and caught myself laughing quite a bit. I had not seen part 1 prior to this movie, although I was told it was not needed. After this I feel like I want to see the first part as well just for pure entertainment. The clown was fantastic and the whole vibe it gave plus the extra laughs was enjoyable.Overall I found it a great mix and definitely enjoyed i, would recommend for sure as an avid horror movie fan.",neutral
"I don't understand why Leone's movies have such a strong cult following. Art is entertaining at times but they're mostly empty movies with nothing to say. The reason why torture films like Saw and Hostel work is cause Saw has an intelligent, intricate plot with stakes in the characters' decisions, and Hostel has character development and deeper meaning and message. Leone's movies are just like let's cut people up over and over again. And it's not that I can't handle what he shows, I'm a big horror buff, but his movies are boring, poorly acted, and have nothing going on. Along with Mike Flanagan, Leone is the most overrated in horror filmmaking right now.",negative
"This film falls in the category of being quite entertaining and it was okay to watch once, but I wouldn't watch it again.I like Art The Clown, I like the introduction of his little assistant, I like the killing scenes even if they are slightly over the top and look quite fake. I only struggled towards the end throughout the final scenes (last 30 mins or so) where the final parts of reality go out the window. Sadly this is the case with a lot of horrors. The scare factor comes mainly from realism and as soon as superpowers are introduced, it makes the film less interesting. In summary, a very strange film.",negative
"I'm gonna start with this. I had high hopes for this movie, and somehow Dir. Leone exceeded them by like, quite a few miles. This is the only film to have me squirm in my seat and gag, and I loved every second of it. David Howard Thornton is DERANGED. I love it. This film is also one of the only horror films that I absolutely love the central protagonists. Lauren LaVera & Elliot Fullam knocked this out of the park, and I'm not even gonna mention how eerie the entire setting is. Oh, and that terrifying demon girl (Amelie McLain, you freaked me out), that is the icing on top of this. Definitely one of my new favorite slashers that I'm definitely gonna revisit over and over every Halloween.",neutral
"Terrifier 2, directed by Damien Leone, is a highly anticipated horror sequel that builds upon the sadistic and gory elements of its predecessor. While the film delivers on its horror and gore aspect, it falls short in terms of acting execution, pacing, and logical consistency.Set in a desolate town, Terrifier 2 follows the murderous clown Art as he wreaks havoc on unsuspecting victims. The film explores sadistic torture and showcases brutal gore, catering to fans of extreme horror. However, it is marred by several issues that hinder its overall impact.The acting in Terrifier 2 is a mixed bag. At times, the performances feel unconvincing and fail to fully immerse the audience in the story. This detracts from the film's ability to create a genuinely terrifying atmosphere. Additionally, the pacing of the movie feels overly prolonged, resulting in a sense of dragging and a lack of narrative momentum.One of the major shortcomings lies in the inclusion of magical weapons, specifically a sword, towards the end of the film. These elements seem out of place and defy the established rules of the movie's universe, leaving the audience questioning their significance and relevance to the story.Furthermore, the portrayal of the main character as seemingly invincible diminishes the sense of suspense and stakes. This choice detracts from the tension that could have been built around the encounters with Art and undermines the believability of the plot.The final fight scene, while intended to be climactic, suffers from an excessive length. Instead of delivering a satisfying conclusion, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact, eventually becoming tiresome for the audience.Terrifier 2 excels in its horror and gore aspect, delivering scenes that are genuinely disturbing and unsettling. The film embraces its sadistic nature, providing fans of extreme horror with the gruesome content they seek. The practical effects are commendable, adding to the authenticity of the gore.However, there are instances where the victims survive for an extended period, despite the severity of their injuries. This inconsistency breaks the immersion and logic of the film, undermining the tension and realism that could have been established.While Terrifier 2 offers a satisfactory dose of horror and gore, it falls short in several critical areas. The poorly executed acting, prolonged pacing, illogical inclusion of magical weapons, and the main character's invincibility undermine the overall quality of the film. The never-ending fight scene further dampens the experience. Nevertheless, if you have a strong stomach for sadistic horror and enjoy extreme gore, the movie may still provide some macabre enjoyment.Terrifier 2 presents a mixed viewing experience. It successfully delivers on the horror and gore front, but is let down by issues in acting execution, pacing, logical consistency, and an overextended climax. It will primarily appeal to fans of extreme horror who prioritize sadistic violence over narrative coherence. Proceed with caution if you find yourself drawn to the macabre, as Terrifier 2 offers a visceral but flawed journey into brutality.",positive
"When Terrifier 2 came out, some internet buzz and other publicity talked about how it was the goriest movie ever and that many people had been sickened during various screenings of it. However, some of them may have been sickened by other aspects of this over-bloated, full-of-itself sequel that seems to have been ""written"" by a comittee of 20 people.Today is October 18th, and.during the Halloween season, I like to watch a new movie and possibly review it. So, what are the problems of Terrifier 2?1. No soul. Over two movies., no mention of Art the Clown's backstory or raison d'etre is ever broached. Yes, other movies that have tried to give history to a serial slasher have failed, such as Rob Zombie's Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Beginning, but for Terrifier 2, this means all the onscreen carnage lacks context.2. It's over-long. The sweet spot for this type of horror movie is about 90 minutes to just short of two hours, tops. This one clocks in at an exhausting 2 hours and 15 minutes with no payoff.3. Bad acting. So, it's not ""Troll 2"" bad, which might have made it more interesting, but it's bad enough that you start having thoughts like ""I hope they paid these kids a lot to be in this"" because with reshots and staging it must have been grueling, which means the characters themselves are un-engaging and you don't ""feel their pain.""4. Some of the gore defies physics and is unrealistic. To explain exactly how would create spoilers, so suffice it to say that a lot of it looks like mannequins with squirting blood sacs, which is what it may exactly have been in a couple of cases.5. It's boring. There is a half-a$$ attempt to create hip dialog between some of the younger characters, but it's gag-worthy and manipulative.In short, Terrifier 2 is a terrifying waste of time!",positive
"Terrifier 2 is a rare case of the sequel being better than the original. The original was also fantastic, but Terrifier 2 takes everything great about that film, and buids on it creating an experience that is close to perfection.We actually get some plot/backstory this time. It is vauge/somewhat confusing, but it works well enough where the crew could make a great narrative in the future. The acting here is great. Art somehow manages to turn up his brutality, which from the original film I didn't know was possible.(So many insane moments) We also get to meet one of the most interesting final girls I've ever seen in Sienna.I cannot rate this film highly enough, and I can't wait for the release of Terrifier 3. Until then I'll just be over here constantly singing along to ""Clown Cafe"".",neutral
"The first one was good because it was short and sweet. Well, short and bloody creative. If you're going to feature the same B-tier acting, we don't need 300 additional lines of dialog. The Final girl Sienna was acted very well don't get me wrong. But there's absolutely no reason a slasher should be over 2 hours. I think the director heard the criticism of the first Terrifier having no plot and over corrected. Why exactly do we need magic, comics, and weird singing? We don't. All we asked for was a clown and blood. Could've cut half of the scenes here easily. The blonde friend and her.....boyfriend? The whole party sequence... I'm just spitballing here. Anyway, my favorite part was seeing Felissa Rose in a cameo. Well, gonna go watch Sleepaway Camp again!",negative

The cinematography is a triumph, expertly capturing the macabre beauty within the horror. The pacing keeps you on the edge, never relenting in its relentless pursuit of terror. Director Damien Leone's vision is on full display, orchestrating a symphony of fear that leaves you breathless. ""The Terrifier 2"" is a must-watch for horror aficionados, an unapologetically gruesome dance of dread that lingers long after the credits roll...
